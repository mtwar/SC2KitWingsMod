Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00002=So we've transferred all the artifact pieces to Valerian's people?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00003=Yes, all gone. I'm sort of relieved to be honest, Commander. Working in here late at night was starting to -ah- you know, strain my scientific detachment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00004=Well it's down to the Moebius scientists to figure it all out now. I hope for their sake they get it right.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00005=Don't you mean for all our sakes?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00006=No, I was thinking more about how I'll hunt every one of them down if they screw this thing up.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00007=All that sweat and blood getting the artifacts... Now we've given them away to Valerian so he can build a super weapon to stop Kerrigan.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00008=Hell, this had better work or I'm just the dumbest jackass alive.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00009=Can you tell me anything about this artifact? I gotta admit... it kinda weirds me out.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00025=Guess we'll find out soon enough. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00026=I've done some preliminary studies. Your artifact is a few thousand years old, but that makes it pretty 'young' in Xeno-archaelogical terms. Most alien artifacts are millions of years old. By comparison, this one was made recently.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00027=It ain't like anything protoss I've ever seen. But if they didn't make it... who did?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00030=I've been hearing strange stories from the crew of late - unexplained noises, strange visions - voices in the dark. Rumor has it these things are haunted.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00031=Superstitious nonsense! These artifacts are completely inert and they're contained down here in the lab. There is some trace radiation, but I don't see how they could affect things elsewhere on the ship!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00032=[Surprise]Heaven forbid we run across alien tech that messes with our primitive little monkey brains.[/Surprise] Just keep a close eye on 'em, Doc.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00033=Holding these artifacts is making me nervous. Can you tell me any more about them?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00034=It's interesting - the one from Xil is different than the others. However, I think all of them once constituted a single device. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00035=You mean they make something bigger? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00036=It would seem so. It's just a theory, but there's an attraction between the artifacts we've collected - a kind of harmonic resonance. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00037=Given the points of contiguous translinear alignment I think they'd be drawn together like magnets under the right field adjustment.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00038=Ohhhh kay. Well don't adjust anything just yet, Doc. I like them aligned just the way they are.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00039=So these things are still a big mystery, huh?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00040=Actually I have found something interesting. Whenever you use that protoss device over there, the artifacts respond by drawing together and expanding their molecular matrices.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00041=A little slower and with shorter words, please.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00042=Well, if you think of them as dry sponges, they draw ambient energy like water. These things try to absorb as much energy as they can.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00043=Are they dangerous?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00044=Not if you're human. If my theories are correct - and you were a protoss, for instance - they could drain the life right out of you.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00045=Valerian reckons this thing can...de-zergify Kerrigan once it's rebuilt. Do you think that's even possible?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00046=From what I've managed to piece together, it might be. The artifact seems to absorb protoss energy. If the same holds true for zerg...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00047=(Snaps) Just yes or no, Ariel. I need an answer!
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00048=(snaps back) If I said 'no' would you even believe me? The only person who can really know what the artifact does is the one who made it - and they're long gone...I hope.

Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00006=--- An energy bridge formed by their combined powers allows them to escape. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00007=TIP - New Unit Acquired - Zealots are sturdy frontline melee units that form the backbone of any protoss army.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00008=Protoss units are protected by shields that regenerate rapidly when they are not in combat.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Comment00009=TIP - New Unit Acquired - Stalkers are versatile ranged units that can use the Blink ability to instantly shift location.

Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00002=Fascinating, but these are just fragments of the prophecy. I must continue my search.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00004=Gods, what does it all mean?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00005=Fragments of truth, perhaps. I cannot decipher the prophecy on my own. Yet I know who might interpret these findings for us - the Preservers of Zhakul!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00006=The holy Archives have been sealed off for a thousand years. What makes you think the Preservers will heed your plea now?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00007=Because if they do not... this entire universe will burn. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00009=En Taro Tassadar, Zeratul! We received your transponder signal. Many of our brothers are still searching for you across this wasteland. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00010=Let us find them, young zealot. There is much to be done before we depart this place.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00014=That Overseer will alert the zerg! Stalkers! Kill it! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00016=Prelate Zeratul! At last! Fortune smiles upon us. I am Arch-Templar Karass. Hierarch Artanis sent me here to find you. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00017=Greetings, Karass. Aid me in my quest, and we shall return to Artanis together! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00018=These symbols... so similar to those in the caverns below. "The Cycle draws to its end"... And here, it speaks of the "Stars waking from celestial courses"... 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00019=This shrine has etchings like the others... Some reference here to "a Great Devourer consuming all hope"... and more about a "final darkness..." 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00020=More inscriptions. They speak of  "the stars being consumed by a vast shadow"... Grim portents. But here - a final inscription speaks of "another... who will break the cycle of the gods..." 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00021=More Zerg! Ready yourselves my brothers, this battle will be a bloody one.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00022=Perhaps not, prelate. Permit me to clear the way with a psionic storm.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00024=We are trapped! Unless....Karass, lend me your strength -- between us we can forge a means of escape!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00025=I do not understand, great one, how?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00026=The power of the Void and the Khala together! The twilight energies will be our salvation -- now focus!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00032=Did you find what you sought, Zeratul?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00037=We require assistance!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00038=Quickly brothers! Protect the Stalkers! Guard their flank to prevent the zerg from surrounding them!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00039=Our thanks, exalted one. We are yours to command.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00081=You've struggled so long, Zeratul. Give in. Come to me and I will send you to your rest, at long last.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Comment00001=The camera fades in to show Raynor standing before the glowing ihan crystal. He looks tense. 
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Comment00002=Camera cuts back to the crystal showing Zeratul's floating head. 
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Comment00003=Camera cuts to show swirly image of ULAAN - camera slowly pans in on the planet (2D image).

Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00001=The Void Seeker flies over to the landing site. Zeratul unloads and looks around.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00002=A stalker appears near the unpowered buildings.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00003=The vault opens up and the spirit of Preserver 1 arises and addresses the player. Preservers 2 and 3 emerge behind it.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00004=The preservers warn zeratul telepathically
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00005=The Archival Nexus. It starts out dark but flares into blinding life as we watch. A HYBRID is briefly silhouetted as it teleports in. We're left with an impression of burning eyes...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00006=Pylon power - Protoss structures need power to function. This is supplied by building a pylon close to them.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00007=Zhakul: Forbidden Archive World
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00009=The stalker attack. Zeratul defeats it.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00010=New Unit Acquired - Immortals are potent combat walkers protected by an energy field that blocks very powerful attacks.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00011=Camera cuts back to the Preservers as they float above the Archival Nexus. They begin to glow as the Archival apparatus opens up/starts spinning beneath them.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00012=Camera starts revolving around Preserver 2.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00013=Camera cuts to Zeratul as he watches, transfixed.

Conversation/TZeratul02/Comment00018=As Zeratul's force approach, several dark templar appear.

Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00003=The camera cuts to show the mission MAP. As it pans - we see the three Archive-vaults, and the protoss units that guard them. We see the three Preservers (each spectral form glowing white, blue and violet, respectively)
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00004=Camera cuts to the starting area - where drones are building a base. 
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Comment00005=Camera cuts back to Zeratul:

Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00001=After Zeratul kills one - power up!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00002=Zeratul activates the waygate. A number of protoss units emerge from its energy matrix. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00003=A squad of colossi arrive. They are magnificent. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00004=The camera cuts away to a pre-built zerg creep-out area. We are in heavy shadow. In the HEAVY RED LIGHT we see a few zerg larvae creeping around in the muck. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00005= We see the larva enter its egg state. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00006= We see the egg explode as a zerglings crawls out. It sniffs the air (or emotes somehow).   
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00007=A wave of additional zerglings race up behind the first one and charge across the screen. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00008= The first zerglings emotes and then starts running with them as the camera pans up and around the swarming creatures. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00009=The visions ends... we cut back to Zeratul standing near the tendril node.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00010=The camera cuts away to a view of SPACE. Through HEAVY RED LIGHT we see a swarm of zerg flyers moving slowly across a star field. The camera pans around them - showing their alien grace and majesty as a swarm. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00011=Camera swings around to show the space BEHIND this swarm... there we see DEAD WORLDS behind them... Could be 2D - gray/lifeless - or aflame (whatever)... we want to show the swarm as hugely destructive.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00012= The camera cuts to show a worm-hole SLOWLY open up before the swarm (similar to the Zerg victory flic <n/>in Star1 - this will use the 'black hole' Mothership spell art). The zerg 'get pulled in' to the black hole as if <n/>using it as a wormhole for travel...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00013=All the zerg 'teleport' through the wormhole - leaving only silent stars before us. The scene starts to go black. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00014= Camera cuts back to Zeratul as he stands before the tendril node. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00015=The camera cuts away to a zerg 'room' - a dark chamber covered with CREEP. HEAVY RED LIGHT and shadow... the camera slowly pans around the room... A strong heartbeat is heard echoing throughout the chamber.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00016=Camera stops tracking at the center of the room - as we see a CHRYSALIS (similar to Star1). 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00017= Camera starts zooming in towards the chrysalis. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00018=The chrysalis begins to warp and flex - something is tearing its way out. The heartbeat is faster - thundering now. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00019= We see KERRIGAN arise from the Chrysalis. The camera slowly pans around her form - revealing her majesty. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00020= We see tons of zerg rushing at her - swarming around her as their new queen. Camera cuts back to Zeratul.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00021=Zeratul enters and sees... Tassadar.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00022=The camera pans down to the scenes as the combat gets nasty. We see GANTRITHOR flying on-screen as in the BRIEFING. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00023=The camera pans down to the scenes as the combat gets nasty. We see GANTRITHOR flying on-screen as in the BRIEFING. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00024=As the camera spirals to the ground (tracking Gantrithor), there is a FLASH of white light. The camera slowly fades back in to show Kerrigan standing on the battlefield as zerg swarm around her. Camera pans down toward her as she unleashes her powers against the protoss forces. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00025=The whole scene starts fading to black. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00026=Cut back to Zeratul.

Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00030=Colossi engage
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00031=New unit acquired - Observers are robotic aerial spies that can detect burrowed zerg. They cannot attack, but are afforded protection by a permanent cloaking field.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00032=New unit acquired -  Colossi are strong against ground based forces but vulnerable to air units. They have the ability to walk up and down cliffs.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Comment00033=Warp In - Warp Gates allow you to create units faster than ordinary gateways and deploy them to any place with pylon power.

Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00003= Ah - the creatures' energies feed my own! That could prove useful. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00008=The first tendril node! Gods willing, some trace of the Overmind remains...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00009=Zerg. This is the first expression of all that I am.  
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00010=The perfect design...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00011=Bred to assimilate the strongest species...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00012=A perfect genetic ferocity...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00013=Driven by a perfect, single-minded will...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00014=I have glimpsed the Overmind's origins... but there must be more! I must keep moving. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00015=The second tendril node! I must make contact quickly! 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00016=Long did the Swarm wander the void...Assimilating the lesser species it encountered.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00017=I was driven by the deepest manipulations of the Xel'Naga - to find and assimilate their first born...their failed children...the protoss.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00018=I was nothing more than an instrument to the Xel'Naga...The Swarm was the raging fire that would consume the evidence of their sins.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00019=But what of my children? Would they have no future of their own?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00020=The Overmind seemed almost... selfless. I must press on. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00021=The third node at last! 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00022=The Xel'Naga had created me to eradicate their failed children - the protoss - in a battle neither species would survive.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00023=I could do nothing...but obey.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00024=Yet I deemed the purity of the Swarm was greater than my function - greater even than the Creators' Pyrrhic vision. I would birth...an inheritor.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00025=One who would give the Swarm its freedom.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00026=And help it to...evolve.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00027=Kerrigan. (beat) Could the Overmind have created her... to stop the Xel'Naga's return? 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00028=The final tendril node... Gods, grant me the answers I seek. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00029=I made my war against the first born as I was destined to.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00030=Before I could assimilate the protoss - I was undone.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00031=Yet my...daughter...remained. She alone would break the cycle. She alone would forge a future devoid of the hated Xel'Naga.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00032=She alone would lead the Swarm ...into tomorrow.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00033=I can scarcely believe what I have seen. What terrible irony - that the wretched Queen of Blades... is the key to saving all who live. 
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00064=Overmind! Trace impulses of the foul creature do linger!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00066=Who did this?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00068=I care nothing for your hopes. Tell me of the prophecy, damn you!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00070=The Queen of Blades? Madness!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00072=No! This vision! I cannot bear it, stop!

Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00003= Camera cuts to show THE PAST- where the Overmind (alive and well) sits atop the fields of Aiur. As Zeratul speaks, we see the Gantrithor (brisling with twilight energy) careening down towards it. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Comment00004= The screen FLASHES WHITE (suggesting the catastrophic impact when the ship hit the Overmind). The camera cuts back to PRESENT DAY - the Overmind is now just a massive, rotting HUSK. The sky is red... zerg swarm everywhere...

An oppressive RED HAZE hangs over the maps as we pan down to see a massive PROTOSS BASE being attacked by super-powered HYBRID. Though seen only distantly, it's clear the hybrid are whomping the snot out of the protoss. 
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00003= Camera cuts to show the hybrid in action. They are terrifying and majestic all at once. 
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Comment00004= The camera cuts away to show massive explosions of psionic energy ripping up the base. Massive psi-storms are being unleashed across the map. The onslaught is overwhelming.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 2=The firebat suit contains a volatile mix of gasses that seep into the operator compartment. This may explain why firebat personnel are almost universally resocialized criminals or psychotic pyromaniacs.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryFirebat/Info/Description 3=Perdition flamethrowers spew combusto-plasma at enemy targets. The plasma easily seeps into gaps in zerg carapaces. Smaller zerg creatures are literally cooked alive inside their own skins.

ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 2=Introduced by the Confederacy shortly before the fall of Tarsonis, the Mark VI is considered the pinnacle of ghost antipersonnel weaponry. The Dominion, unable to improve upon the design, has carried on production.
ConversationState/Hotspots/ArmoryGhostRifle/Info/Description 3=Despite their great skill, ghosts are notoriously sloppy when calling down nuclear strikes. Modern commanders are always happy to see a ghost's rifle, for it contains a magnetic grid tracker to verify coordinates.

ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description=<s val="Lab_Text">Protoss "crystal" sample recovered by Raynor's Raiders, 10.7.2504.<n/><n/>I placed the crystal in saline solution for storage. Its density has increased 553% in the last twelve hours. Where does it get energy or raw materials for that? I have a terrible suspicion that it's... connecting to the ship somehow. If Swann suspects, he'll drop it out the airlock, and that would be a tragedy. This sample could lead to huge breakthroughs for the Raiders.<n/> <n/>I just have to be careful, and if there's any sign that it will harm the Hyperion, I'll destroy the crystal myself.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 2=<s val="Lab_Text">The crystal is growing, and it appears to have something--some sort of... anti-matter? Gravitational anomaly? Non-standard phenomenon?--hovering over it. I'm now convinced that the crystal is drawing power from the ship, but in ways so subtle as to be undetectable. <n/><n/>It is non-organic but has a molecular structure as diverse and complex as any organism's. It's developed an intricate matrix that makes it tough and surprisingly flexible. An alloy based on this crystal would have impressive damage mitigation. The structure of this matrix also suggests some sort of energy-storage system. There might be something to this.<n/><n/>The protoss are so far beyond us. We must seem amoeboid to them.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 3=<s val="Lab_Text">The protoss crystal continues to grow. I no longer think it is drawing power from the ship. It's getting pure energy from that sphere above it, which presents a new worry. What's it doing with all that power? Is it going to release it explosively? I have to keep Swann away from the sample; he will definitely shoot it out the airlock. With me strapped to it.<n/><n/>I tried scraping smaller samples, but all my tools broke. Luckily, I found some cast-off chips floating in the tank. Wonder how they came off? In any case, the chips revealed more of the matrix. It's keeping the energy there in a vortex. How does it move the energy so fast? It may be the fabled protoss warp technology. For all its complexity, the matrix is as solid as the strongest structure. Hm, I wonder if I could apply these dynamics to our own structures? Make a note.<n/><n/>I'm learning so much from this crystal, but I can't help feeling as if it's learning from me, if that makes sense. Late. Tired. Sleep now.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 4=<s val="Lab_Text">I've been staring at that anomalous sphere above the crystal. It's obviously an energy emitter, but it has such strong containment that the crystal can slowly draw power from it via some method I don't understand. That gives me an idea: using our own containment technology, I could modify our SCV manufacturing process to double capacity with no increased risk. I think.<n/><n/>Breakthrough! The energy in this crystal is not kept in a vortex pattern. It was warping the energy around so fast that I couldn't detect it. In an odd coincidence, the warping slowed just enough for my sensors to pick it up. Not sure how or why. Every time I reach my wits' end with this sample, something happens by... chance... and I get a breakthrough.<n/><n/>Is it helping me? Clearly I've been working too many hours. I'm going to go lose some more credits on Lost Viking.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 5=<s val="Lab_Text">Okay, I may be exceeding the boundaries of good science, but I am now sure this crystal has some sort of... if not sentience, at least... direction. I put a broken nano-fabricator in the tank last night, and today it's fixed.  And it can accomplish things it shouldn't. If I can reverse engineer this fabricator, I could do amazing things with automated repair, or even near-instant manufacturing of advanced AI weaponry. Possibilities are limitless.<n/><n/>On the less upbeat end of things, the level of energy stored in the crystal's matrix has not increased at all, despite the fact that the crystal continues to grow. So it must be emitting that energy somehow, some... where.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeProtoss/Info/Description 6=<s val="Lab_Text">All of the containment and reinforced structural integrity theorems I've developed from studying this crystal are starting to... well... crystallize. I think we might be able to contain energies that once required huge machines. Or even manufacture structures capable of hot landings from orbital origins with acceptable stresses.<n/><n/>I'm a sham. I haven't truly learned anything from this crystal. I've just observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when the crystal... helped me. I don't understand how the protoss can possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe. Perhaps they simply don't want to?<n/><n/>Last entry on this sample. I figured out where it is putting all that excess energy. It's feeding the Hyperion. Subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged systems. It's giving of itself, and has been since it got here. Swann is excited that the ship is running so well, but he has no idea why. And I'm not going to tell him.</s>

ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg=Zerg Tank
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/EditorPrefix=Lab -
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description=<s val="Lab_Text">Zerg sample recovered by Raynor's Raiders, 6.10.2504.<n/><n/>Sample appeared dead when brought in, including tissue necrosis. However, tests now reveal frantic cellular activity, and it is moving. <n/><n/>This defies everything I understand about biology. I'm tracking massive generational changes in each cell. In the last hour, this thing has evolved more than humans did in 100,000 years.<n/><n/>If I can harness this, it could lead to huge military innovations for the Raiders.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 2=<s val="Lab_Text">The recovered zerg sample is still growing. I introduced a protein solution. Might have been a mistake.<n/><n/>At the cellular level, the sample shows strains of every known zerg creature--and many other strains that I don't recognize. It will take a while to map it all, but I've already begun extracting data from an ultralisk cell, and I found a spore crawler cell that yielded data on its instinctive threat-recognition routines.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 3=<s val="Lab_Text">Recovered zerg sample continues to evolve. Clearly has motor function despite the lack of anything like a neural cortex. It's giving off more heat than it could possibly be absorbing in that tank.<n/><n/>I'm learning how some zerg burrow so well. It's extremely sophisticated. They have billions of tiny muscles that vibrate at a low frequency, effectively loosening soil, crumbling rock, and snapping vegetation. They can "swim" through the ground. It's not quite as fast as running, but it's close.<n/><n/>I can see a way to put this knowledge to good use.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 4=<s val="Lab_Text">The zerg sample has developed an ocular organ. Will limbs be next? There is a basic dichotomy to zerg cell reproduction. Type A cells throw off seemingly random mutations. Type B cells hunt down these mutations and destroy them. It's survival of the fittest on the cellular level. Successful mutations thrive.<n/><n/>I used microscopic scrapings from the sample to test an electrical discharge field I'd been tinkering with for some time. The results were gratifying. As an interesting side effect, the zerg matter developed into a very dense but flexible material. This material could be used to reinforce the superstructure of those old Hercules-class cargo ships that Swann's always trying to find a use for.<n/> <n/>I wish there were time to both pursue the discharge field and iterate on the hardened matter. I doubt there will be.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 5=<s val="Lab_Text">The zerg sample has developed a large neural cortex. I've noticed it reacting to external stimuli, but in a very disturbing way. When it detects my presence, it stops moving. Is it trying to "play dead"? Can it react at that level?<n/><n/>I noticed earlier that zerg alpha amino acids have unique R groups. I've run a full regimen on some. Results are stunning. Zerg aminos are able to combine dead cell matter with normal proteins to biosynthesize new cells. They don't suffer generational cell degradation. Simply put, a zerg will never die of old age. They can constantly renew themselves, albeit with radically changing cell structure.<n/><n/>We could never harness this for biological use with terrans: the results would be foregone and horrifying. But I wonder if I could alloy zerg tissue with some of our metals to make buildings that heal? The renewal process also throws off immense energy as a byproduct. Something there. I should see about harnessing that energy.</s>
ConversationState/Hotspots/LabTubeZerg/Info/Description 6=<s val="Lab_Text">The sample is trying to escape. I've detected several new acids in the nutrient solution. Over time, they will crack the tank. I wonder if Commander Raynor can post some marines down here? No; he'll want to destroy it. I haven't learned everything I can from this thing yet.<n/><n/>Breakthrough. I dosed some tissue with concentrated sigma radiation, and it slowed growth and movement severely. It would take a lot of work to safely deploy that much radiation on the battlefield, but it might be worth it.<n/><n/>Another breakthrough, and this one scares me. I mapped my way through the DNA of some brain tissue, peering back thousands of years, and I isolated the strain from which the zerg Overmind was derived. Not enough to clone the Overmind, but I could follow this strand to gain insight into how it controlled the zerg.</s>
