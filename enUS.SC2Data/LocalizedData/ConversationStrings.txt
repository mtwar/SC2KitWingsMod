Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00001=You look confused, honey. Maybe you should get some rest?
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00002=Get your head on straight, sugar. You're gonna be just fine. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00003=You're a fine, man, Commander. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00004=Go get 'em, sugah. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00031=Commander Jim Raynor, as I live and breathe.
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00032=Sure does get hot and sweaty down here in the armory. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00033=I was just thinkin' how much I'd enjoy a tall glass of water...
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00034=Need any pipes worked on?
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00035=Well ain't you a sight for sore eyes?
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00001=Things are getting' tense around here, Commander. We're countin' on ya. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00002=Ya' got things under control, sir? 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00003=The Hyperion's at full strength, Commander. We're good to go!
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00004=We're with ya, sir. Raynor's Raiders strike again!
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00067=Armory's lookin' good, sir. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00068=Don't mind Swann, sir. His claw's rustin' over and he gets a bit edgy. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00069=Everyone get to work! The Commander's right there!
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00070=What do ya' need, Commander? I'll get right on it. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00071=Engines are running strong, sir. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsEarl/Line00072=We'll keep the old bird together, Commander. You can count on us. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00001=You look lost or somethin', sir. The Cantina's two decks up. 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00002=Don't you have a revolution to run... sir? 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00003=Good to see ya', Commander! 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00004=We'll have this old bird in fightin' shape for ya', sir! 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00061=What?
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00062=Yeah, I'm workin'! I'm workin'!
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00063=I got work to do here... sir.
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00064=Somethin' I can help ya' with, Commander? 
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00065=Yeah, whatever you say, Commander.
Conversation/ArmoryFidgetsKachinsky/Line00066=Hey, we gettin' paid soon or what?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00008=Never thought we'd be back on Meinhoff again. Ugh. [Angry 70]We broke our backs tryin' to make a life on that rock... Kel-Morians squeezing us dry. [/Angry]'Day we rose up... we just couldn't take it anymore, y'know?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00013=I feel ya'. Man's got a duty to stand up and be counted sometimes.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00017=So how'd you enjoy your little vacation dirtside?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00018=How're you holding up down here, chief?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00019=Ah hell, we were stupid. Havin' right on your side ain't no match for gauss guns and combat walkers. Lotta' folks died for nothin'. If you hadn't shown up when you did...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00020=Hey, your people bought their own freedom - paid for it in blood. Me and Matt, we were just glad to help.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00021=Next time you need a volunteer, you go right ahead and volunteer someone else!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00023=What do ya' mean?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00024=Your girl's made herself a lot of enemies over the years. If that damned artifact does what you hope it does they won't hesitate goin' through you to get to her.   
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00025=(chuckles) Thanks, man. You know we couldn't have done it without you.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00026=[Happy 70]Better now we got our old commander back. [/Happy]Oh, and our new best friend Prince Charming came through with some upgraded battlecruiser schematics. I been working on some... interesting modifications for our ships.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00030=Upgrading what we got is all well and good, but when're we getting new hardware? Lotta gaps in our inventory right now.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00040=What's up, cowboy? Y'know you're lookin' kinda rough lately - rougher than usual, I mean.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00041=That Tosh character gave me the data for buildin' more Spectre gear. You sure we can trust that guy? I heard he was into brainwashing or something. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00042=Tosh can only recruit volunteers to become Spectres. That's the deal. He works 'em hard so they won't go off the rails when they get their full Spectre powers. No brainwashing involved.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00043=[Happy 50]Good to know. Wouldn't want any of those freaks running loose causin' trouble. [/Happy]Aside from Tosh, that is. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00044=Nova promised us access to Ghost technology for helping her. She come through with it yet?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00045=Your girl came through, alright. I got a few new upgrades we're workin' on too.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00046=So...what's the problem, Swann? 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00047=I'll check 'em out. Where we're going we're gonna need all the firepower we can get.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00048=She ain't 'my girl', Swann. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00049=[Surprise 70]Hmm... scary female assassin type that's gonna wind up tryin' to kill you someday?[/Surprise] I dunno, hotshot - she sure seems like your type.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00050=(mutters) ...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00055=[Happy]Those goofy mercs are still using Vultures, can ya believe it? [/Happy]Damn things are death traps even when you ain't got people shooting at ya.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00056=Careful now, Swann. My old Vulture saved my skin more times than I care to remember. I ain't gonna listen to you trash talk a classic piece of engineering like that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00057=Classic?! I suppose you could call 'em that. 'Course most folks like a bike that don't explode on them when the repeller seals freeze up, or the fuel cells start leaking radioactive waste - [Happy 70]but hey, who cares if it's a 'classic', right?[/Happy]
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00058=No one likes a smart-ass, Swann. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00059=I've...ah...got a lot goin' on right now, Swann. You know how it is.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00060=So Swann, what're the chances we can build something like that Odin?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00061=[Surprise 70] You nuts? [/Surprise]No way we got the facilities for mass-producing hardware on that scale.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00062=And here I was thinking you could build anything, Swann.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00063=Cute. Alright - forget the scale! I'm gonna figure it out, don't you worry. An' I'll come up with something a damn sight more practical than that show piece. You see if I don't!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00064=Yeah, sure. Y 'know you might wanna try laying off the sauce and getting some shuteye once in a while, eh?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00065=Man, did ya see the size of that protoss ship? Don't matter how often I see 'em, those guys always come out with something that makes your jaw drop. Know what I'm sayin'?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00066=I'd be more impressed if they were using all that power against the zerg. It's stupid to be killing protoss when we should be teaming up with them against Kerrigan.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00067=Listen - they deserved it, and you did the right thing. Friends don't let friends massacre civilians, Jim. I'm proud of you for standing up to 'em.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00068=Do you think we coulda saved more of those colonists? 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00069=Honest? No. And you got your head up your ass if you think any different.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00070=There had to be a better answer, though. Maybe if we caught it earlier...
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00071=Look, if the protoss with all their tech, psionics and big freakin' alien brains couldn't do anything for them - there ain't nothing we coulda done. Sometimes life's just rough that way.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00076=We're rockin' some serious heavy metal now that we got siege tanks.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00077=Yessir... the comforting thunder of the big guns. Well, comforting when they're on our side.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00078=Yeah these newer tanks have better guns when they're on the move, and reinforced armor.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00079=So long as they've still got the range in siege mode, the rest is just gravy. Between siege tanks and bunkers, we can hold the line against just about anythin'.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00080=Thanks, mom. I'll get right on that.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00081=Oh what the hell, cowboy, you look like crap. You been thinking about that girl again?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00082=Kinda. I just got some bad news 'bout what might happen if we can't save her.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00083=Bah, no use worrying about what might happen if you ask me. You want me to help, you just let me know. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00087=[Surprise 70]What's the problem?[/Surprise] [Angry 70]You only signed us up with our mortal enemies! Every one of these boys lost family or friends to Mengsk! [/Angry] [Sad 70]We're gonna be sittin' on a powder keg pretty soon. Can't you see that?[/Sad]
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00090=Y'know, I been watchin' the logs. Those damn protoss are still way ahead of us. I can't believe some of the stunts they can pull off.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00091=Tell me about it! They've learned some new tricks since the last time we fought.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00092=I mean c'mon, since when could they warp in guys just anywhere? I thought they needed some kinda gateway at least!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00093=Not just anywhere, they need a pylon or another power source close by. Still, they've been working to improve their tech just like us.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00094=(growls) It ain't up for discussion, Swann. I gotta do this.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00101=Ha! Y'see - told ya' I could build something better than that piece o' crap Odin.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00102=I like that. That's the spirit, brother! Show 'em who's boss!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00103=Got some work to do on the chassis still, but I got to thinkin' about upgrades and variants, y'know? They ain't gonna be cheap, cowboy. Big honkin' thing like that never is. But they'll be worth it, you'll see.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00104=That's what I like to hear! I'll take a look and see what's affordable.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00106=What in hell's name did you stir up in that lab, cowboy?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00107=Mengsk's taken to playin' god literally now. He made that thing and whole heap more like it! An' who knows how many other labs he's got out there?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00114=Great, like we ain't got enough to handle with the zerg. Now we got Mengsk breedin' his own damn monsters too.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00115=Oh this is just great, cowboy! I've got critters tryin' to chew through two decks, four engines out and half the defensive turrets are offline!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00116=Can you keep her together, Swann?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00117=Course I can! Havin' the time of my life, brother!
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00118=Well you keep things workin' around here. I'll see what I can do about our rowdy neighbors.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00119=What's your status, Swann?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00120=Crappy. How're you enjoying your little vacation dirtside?
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00121=Not much better. The beer's flat and the locals are ugly. 
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00122=Listen, cowboy  I love you like a brother. I know you got all your hopes pinned on savin' Kerrigan... But just watch your back down there.
Conversation/ArmorySwann/Line00144=Sometimes we take a job with some kinda new hardware and I get a schematic for it so we can make more of 'em. The plans for other stuff we gotta either beg, borrow or steal.
Conversation/Armoryscreentutorial/Line00001=The armory console allows you to purchase upgrades for your units. Each mission you complete will provide funds and access to new units. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00001=They say a man never really knows himself...
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00002=...until his freedom's been taken away. I wonder, how well do you know yourself? 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00003=Prisoner, step forward onto the platform. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00004=Convict 626... Murderer. Pirate... Traitor. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00005=Today... you go free. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00006=But as you'll soon learn... even freedom has a price. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00008=You'll carry your prison with you. That armor will be your new cell.
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00009=Make no mistake - War is coming, with all its glory... and all its horror.
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00011=Mr. Findlay - your freedom awaits. 
Conversation/BetterMarine/Line00012=Hell... it's about time. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00001=Sir, between you and me, you gotta' pull it together. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00002=Everything under control, sir?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00003=Let's get at 'em, sir! 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00004=You know, justice ain't gonna dispense itself...
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00054=I hear ya', Commander.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00055=Talk to me, sir. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00056=Lookin' sharp, sir. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00057=Another fine day on the bridge. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00058=Man, I love bein' a Raider! 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsBralik/Line00059=We got all sorts of ass to kick out there, sir! 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00001=Commander, shouldn't you be... err, commanding?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00002=We're all counting on you, Commander. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00003=Sir, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00004=We're with you, Commander.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00005=You've made a believer out of me, sir. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00007=How can I help you, sir?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00008=It's an honor to serve under you, Commander.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00009=Something's playing havoc with these sensors. I'm on it.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00011=Holding course, Commander.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00012=Steady as she goes. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsCade/Line00038=The Hyperion's running smoothly, sir. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00001=Every day offers a fresh start, sir
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00002=I'm sorry, Commander, what was that order?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00003=Readings look good, Commander. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00004=How you doing today, Commander?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00005=All comm-channels are free and clear, sir.  
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00006=Ready for orders, sir.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00007=Looking good, Commander! There's a new spring in your step! 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00008=We gonna save the universe today, sir?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00014=Great. The starboard generator is offline again. I've got it. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsHall/Line00015=(muted) I heard the Commander spent the past month drunk as a skunk... Oh, sorry, sir. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsStarmap/Line00001=What's our general status, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsStarmap/Line00002=We've picked up a distress call from the planet Agria. There's a colony there under attack by the zerg. 
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsStarmap/Line00007=Your convict buddy Tychus lined up a mission retrieving another artifact. It's on a protoss shrine-world called Monlyth.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsStetmann/Line00001=Uh sir? Any chance you'll get the lab up and running soon? That'd be great.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsbattlereportUI/Line00003=After-action statistics are in, sir.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsbattlereportUI/Line00004=This is what we've got so far.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsbattlereportUI/Line00005=Here's the mission archives for you to review.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsbattlereportUI/Line00006=The mission archives is ready, sir.
Conversation/BridgeFidgetsbattlereportUI/Line00014=All combat data has been collated.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00001=I'm working on a cure for the zerg virus. I just hope my people won't need it.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00003=Well, with the Dominion bein' what it is - someone's got to stand up for the little guy. It sure ain't goin' to be Mengsk.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00004=There are reports of violence and disease spreading throughout the camps, but the Emperor's done nothing!
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00005=I'll look into it, Doc. 
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00031=I've heard a lot about you, Commander. The Dominion always portrayed you as a criminal - a terrorist. There's more to you than it seems.
Conversation/BridgeHanson/Line00034=[Sad 50]Doesn't seem like the Emperor cares at all.[/Sad] My people from Agria, and displaced populations from across the sector, have all fled to a refugee staging area on Meinhoff. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00001=I know, Matt - but it's been four years and we're still no closer to bringing Mengsk down. Now with the zerg back in the mix...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00002=Kerrigan's learning some new tricks. The infestation on Meinhoff seemed particularly... virulent.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00003=We can't be everywhere at once, sir. The important thing is that we set an example and gave them hope.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00007=It's about the worst thing I can imagine - losing who you are like that, all the while being slowly twisted into a damn monster.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00008=Welcome back, sir. Learn anything new from the crystal? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00009=Those classified documents we found on Korhal weren't anything special. Just referred to some old bio-weapons lab orbiting Castanar.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00011=Something I wish I hadn't seen. You remember that zerg-protoss hybrid at the lab we raided? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00014=You ain't gonna believe this, but I just saw Zeratul on the ship.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00015=Ah. How much did you have to drink tonight, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00016=[Angry 70]He was here, Matt. And he was hurt,[/Angry] on the run from something.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00018=[Fear 50]I don't know. But he ain't on this ship anymore. He gave me an Ihan memory crystal and he was desperate for me to study it. [/Fear]I guess he wants me to see what he's seen.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00019=Hard to forget. That thing was an abomination.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00020=Well Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he had to a... temple? Library? Kinda both I guess. A hybrid had already taken over the place. [Fear 70]Just how many of these things are out there?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00021=There's no way we can stop an alien invasion with one capital ship and a handful of volunteers. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00022=Are you alright, sir? Confronting Kerrigan again after all these years...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00023=We've gotta' stop her Matt... no matter what she's after.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00024=Well, we gave her a setback today. The artifacts are obviously important to her, I just wish we knew why.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00031=I've been looking for an encryption expert so we can access the adjutant we recovered. No luck so far.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00034=So, Matt, you planning another strike against Mengsk?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00036=Colonel Orlan at Deadman's Port can crack anything... Haven't been back there in awhile. [Happy 70]Say, didn't you end up gettin' married last time we were there?[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00037=I told you before - If I knew what the prize was, I never woulda' joined that card game!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00038=There's just something about a lovers' reunion that chokes me up.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00039=(sighs)
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00047=Just how bad is it, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00048=Zerg are attacking all over the sector, sir. Mengsk pulled the fleet back to protect the Dominion core-worlds, leaving the fringe worlds to fend for themselves. It's a nightmare.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00049='Best we just stay clear, partner. [Happy 70]We can earn ourselves a fortune working for Moebius while this whole thing blows over.[/Happy]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00050=Zeratul was looking for more clues about the end of the universe -- but this time he was on Aiur.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00052=You don't get it, convict - this isn't gonna just 'blow over'! The zerg won't stop until we're all dead! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00056=Not just yet, sir. I figured we need to focus on the zerg first. Overthrowing Mengsk won't mean anything if we can't beat them.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00057=True. Freedom ain't worth squat if Kerrigan kills us all, that's for sure. Guess Mengsk can wait. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00058=Don't worry, Matt - we ain't sittin' this one out. But we're not exactly in tip top shape either. We'll earn some cash and build up our forces so we can make a difference when it counts.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00060=It sure felt good rescuin' those folks, but there's millions more out there that need help too.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00061=How we doin' up here, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00069=Most days... I don't even know what I'm doin' anymore. Just chasing my damn tail.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00070=No. We've followed your lead from the start. It's your sense of justice that's kept us on this road.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00071=Matt, my interest in justice burned out a long time ago. I've spent my whole life fighting; I've killed, I've ordered good men to their deaths - and for what? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00072=That's because you gave us something to believe in, sir. I'll never give up the fight. That's a promise.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00073=Every time we help folks in need it's another step on the road to a better future.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00074=Good to see you, sir. All available missions are ready for your perusal on the star map.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00075=Matt... I. Hell, just thanks, I guess.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00078=Welcome back, sir. What did you discover from the crystal this time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00082=I know, sir. I won't let you down. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00083=Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00084=(beat) It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00085=(beat) Finishing this thing with Mengsk... it's all I have left. It's guys like you that'll build something better after all the smoke clears.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00086=Sir, I have to question your objectivity on this alliance. It's obviously a trap!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00090=I got it covered, Matt. I'm askin' you to trust me.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00092=You signed up to follow my orders! If you can't do that anymore then get the hell off my ship! 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00093=Good man. This truce won't last forever - just long enough to get the job done.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00094=But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00096=You still got a problem with us working alongside Valerian?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00097=How long was I down in the lab, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00098=You've been gone for hours, sir. You've been in the lab all that time?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00099=I used the Ihan crystal Zeratul gave me. I'd swear it only lasted a few minutes... So vivid... Zeratul's been searching for a Xel'Naga prophecy about the end of the universe. There's more, I just haven't got to it yet.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00100=Matt, If I fail... we're all dead men anyway. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00101=With the platform down the zerg have stopped hammering us. We're finally gaining control of high orbit. [Fear 70]But, sir - this last step  are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?[/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00102=I didn't sign up for this.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00103=It's that obvious I used it, huh? Zeratul took the prophecy fragments he found to a... temple? Library? Kinda both, I guess. But this weird protoss-zerg hybrid had taken over the place. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00104=You mean some sort of infested protoss?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00105=No, this wasn't like infestation at all. It was like someone took the strengths of both races and twisted them together. I gotta tell you - if these things are real, we're in a lot of trouble.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00106=Damn, Matt. I don't even know what to make of this last vision from the crystal.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00107=Aiur? What was he looking for?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00108=He was trying to find out why the Overmind made the Queen of Blades in the first place.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00109=She's the one that's going to destroy the universe?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00110=No, that's just it - I think she's the only one that can save it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00111=You look shaken, sir. What's wrong?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00112=Zeratul called it a vision of the future. It was the end times, Matt. Armageddon. More protoss than we ever knew existed, but there still weren't enough to stop the hybrid.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00113=But what about Kerrigan? Wasn't she supposed to stop them?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00114=In this time-line she was dead. Killed by...us. That's what Zeratul's been trying to tell us all along. She has to live or we're all doomed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00115=Sir.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00116=We were starting to make real progress against Mengsk. If we go after the Queen of Blades, we're throwing that away!
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00117=It's a mess, sir. We're barely holding our orbital positions. Zerg fliers are pounding the hell out of us and Warfield's force is barely holding the landing zone. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00118=I know you're doing the best you can. Just keep things together and we'll make it through this. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00119=This is bigger than Mengsk. Matt, if we succeed on Char, we'll save billions of lives. Billions.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00120=I know taking out those Nydus canals left y'all in the lurch up here... I'm sorry for that. 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00121=You did what you had to do, sir. [Fear 70]But this last step - are you sure you know what you're getting into? What if she can't be saved? Have you really considered that?  [/Fear]
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00122=(beat)It's real simple for me, Matt. I'll never give up on her. Long as there's a chance of bringin' her back, I'll never quit.  
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00123=But what if you fail? Can you live with that? 
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00124=How are things looking, Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00125=Sir, when Tychus came back aboard the ship, I had the techs run a scan on him.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00126=Matt, you need to get a hobby.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00127=Seriously Sir -- his suit contains a sophisticated transponder... if it receives the correct code, it'll shut down all his major organs. That suit is a death trap.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00128=(stunned) He's got a gun to his head.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00129=On a personal note, nice job with Tychus. That ass-kicking's been a long time coming.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00131=Your better future needs to hurry up an' get here or there's gonna be no one left to see it.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00132=And who's got their finger on the trigger? Moebius?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00133=Tychus, what have you gotten yourself into?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00134=Where is he now, sir?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00135=Mengsk can wait.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00136=I think this one might be different. The files suggest they were planning to terminate everyone who ever worked there.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00137=I assume that doesn't mean 'firing' them... But why would Mengsk wanna' kill a whole research staff?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00138=I don't know, but it seems like something we should check out.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00139=It does, indeed.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00140=What do you make of that encrypted message,  Matt?
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00141=I honestly don't know, Sir. If Tosh really is one of these Spectres, it's clear Mengsk would try to ruin your partnership. But Tosh isn't telling us everything. If we're going to win this revolution...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00142=I know... we have to be sure of our allies.
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00143=If any of Dr. Hanson's people on Haven are infested...
Conversation/BridgeHorner/Line00144=I know -- it's just a matter of time before the protoss come looking for them. (beat) Still, I have a history with the protoss. If it comes to that, maybe I can talk 'em down.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00001=I'll think about it. For the time being - welcome aboard the Hyperion. We'll talk later.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00002=Yeah I got another job for us on a world called Bel'Shir. Interested?
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00006=Why are you here, Tosh? Our business is done unless ya got something else for me?
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00008=Everyone knows Jim Raynor wants to put the hurt on Mengsk. I can help you with that...I can help you big time.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00011=Maybe. But what's in it for me? Piracy ain't exactly my chosen path.
Conversation/BridgeTosh/Line00025=Ah here's the man! We make a good team, me and you.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00001=Speaking of tight spots, Tychus - why are you still wearing that suit on my bridge?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00002=Yeah - what, did you bust the zipper or something?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00003=Well, so ya thinking about giving up this life of luxury and becoming a professional broadcaster?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00004=Ok, so I might've had a little help when I broke out of prison. Let's just say it came at a price. I get to stay locked up in this suit 'til I pay off all my debts...
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00005=Aw, regular folk just ain't ready for the raw sex appeal I'd unleash into their grey little lives. I reckon my niche is right here with you, ol' buddy. Right to the end.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00006=I'm glad you're part of all this, Tychus. You did real good today.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00011=I said I can handle it! If you don't want to be a part of this, you can take your thirty percent and go.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00013=(to Tychus) Your debts better not bite us in the ass, Tychus. Coverin' for your shenanigans ain't part of the deal.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00015=I been thinking about Tyrador, and you know - there's gotta be better ways to make a fast buck than divin' headlong into an alien invasion.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00016=Just watch your back, ol' buddy. That's all I'm askin'.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00022=One helluva ship y'got here, Jimmy. How'd you get a hold of a floating palace like this?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00023=The Hyperion was Mengsk's flagship back in the day. Me and Matt decided to 'borrow' her when we parted company with him. This old baby's seen us through some tight spots. 
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00024=If it gets too hairy for ya', just try and think of the money.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00025=I'm trying, old buddy. I'm trying real hard.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00030=And who's collectin' those debts? Who sprung you?
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00033=Them Moebius boys, of course. I didn't just run into them in a museum, y'know. They want them artifacts somethin' fierce.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00038=You sure about this? You gotta know Mengsk is gunnin' for ya. He'll hit you in a way you'll never see coming.
Conversation/BridgeTychus/Line00039=I can handle Mengsk, Tychus. 
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00001=Sir? Swann requested you see him in the armory as soon as possible.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00002=By the way, Sir - you can probably find Tychus in the cantina.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00003=You can find Dr Hanson in the lab, Sir.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00004=Tosh is down in the cantina, Sir.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00005=Sir? Dr Hanson asked to talk to you about that protoss crystal you left in the lab.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsdoor/Line00006=Sir? Stetmann has been asking about that protoss crystal you left in the lab.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsplanetscreen/Line00001=Welcome to the planetary interface, commander. This is where you choose your next mission. Each of the planets at the top of the screen represents a different mission. Select one by clicking on it.
Conversation/Bridgefidgetsplanetscreen/Line00002=When you have a planet selected you can play an audio log about the mission. If you decide to take the mission click on the launch button to begin a full briefing. Simply select a different planet to examine your other missions . 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00001=What up, homes? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00002=Man, you creepin'. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00004=Sit down before you fall down, amigo. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00005=¿Qué pasa?
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00006=Wussup, Jimmy?
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00007=Let's get down to business. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00008=You came to the right place. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00009=Got some help lined up for ya'. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00010=Lots of folks ready to fight... for the right price.
Conversation/CantinaFidgets/Line00011=Made some new contacts. Should check 'em out. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00001=You ain't gonna find your path in a bar, honey. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00002=Just stick to your guns, Commander. We'll make it through this. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00003=Time for celebrating already?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00004=I knew you'd come around.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00005=For the record, honey - I hope you get your girl back. You deserve a little happiness.  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00031=Well ain't you a sweetie.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00032=Well I do declare...
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00033=Buy a girl a drink? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsAnnabelle/Line00035=Can I help you with something, sugar?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00001=Commander, you are an absolute stud! Man, I'll follow you anywhere!
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00002=Good to see ya' back in the saddle, sir! 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00054=Knockin' a few back, huh, sir? I'm down with that! 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00055=Bad-asses like us deserve a little down-time. I know...
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00056=I'm good. I ain't on duty 'till oh four hundred.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00057=Man, old Cooper sure makes a mean Mai Tai...
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00059=Shouldn't you be on the bridge, sir? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsBralik/Line00060=Maybe you should get some rest, Commander. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00007=Ha-ha, off duty at last!
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00008=Steady as she goes. Heh-heh.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00009=It's good to blow off some steam. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00011=I see you in here more and more, sir. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00012=I just want to say, sir,  I'm proud to be a part of this crew. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00013=Things are looking up, Commander! 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCade/Line00038=Is everything okay, Commander?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00001=Now I know you ain't here just for my lively conversation. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00002=Hang in there, boss. Things'll turn around. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00003=Watch your drinkin', boss. The booze has a way o' takin' hold of a man.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00004=Don't you think you've had enough, boss?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00005=Business is boomin' in here. Lot to celebrate, I guess.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00006=Keep your eye on the ball, boss.  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00031=Good to see ya', Commander. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00032=The usual? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00033=What can I get ya, sir? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00034=We got some of that rare Umojan beer in the back. Interested? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsCooper/Line00035=Need to refill your flask? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00067=Buy ya a drink, sir?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00068=We need to get some live entertainment in here.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00069=Is that smell me, or did the Umojan beer go bad?  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00070=Keep it together, sir. The crew's watchin'. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00071=Maybe you should cut back on the boozin' for now. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsEarl/Line00072=I don't even know what we're doing here anymore...
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00001=Sir, I'd like to say, it's a pleasure serving on the Hyperion. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00002=Uh sir, you reek of alcohol. Not that I'm judging... 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00003=Go easy down here, sir. We've got a universe to save! 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00004=It's good to see you energized again, sir. If you don't mind me saying. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00005=All due respect, sir  you don't look so good. We're worryied about ya'.  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00006=I hate to ask, but do you know if Captain Horner is single? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsHall/Line00014=Commander, are you alright?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00001=You're doin' a good job, Commander. We're all with ya - right 'till the end!
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00067=I'm off the clock, sir. Somethin' you need? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00068=May as well get me another round. Hell, maybe even two.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00069=I ain't workin', I'm drinkin'!
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00070=So you down here for your liquid breakfast?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00071=You should take a hard look at yourself, sir. Get it together. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsKachinsky2/Line00072=You sure pulled it together, sir! I'm... real proud to serve on this old heap. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00001=Hope that Tosh dude didn't leave any o' those voodoo dolls layin' around. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00002=Mi abuela always said - that that voodoo, the black magic... it has a way o' catchin' up to you. Tosh got what he deserved, homes.  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00003=There could still be Spectres out there, Raynor. Keep your eyes open. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00004=Project: Shadowblade... who knows what kinds of super-soldiers the Government's created over the years?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00012=Spectres. (scoffs) Good riddance.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00013=You could have done some good, Tosh. Damn shame.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00014=I'm glad that Tosh is out of here. Guy gave me the creeps.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00015=You know Tosh never ordered one single drink while he was here? Hard to trust a man without visible vices. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTTosh03B/Line00045=You were one crazy son of a bitch, Tosh. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00001=Zeratul... wish you were around right now, buddy.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00002=With everything we're dealing with, I know there's something bigger brewing out there in the dark. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00004=That's from your friend Zeratul, right? I saw him with you once a few years ago. Pretty scary guy, if you ask me. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00006=Hey, chico - is that a dark templar relic hangin' up there? What, did ya' kill one or something?
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00008=Imagine what I could charge for an army of invisible alien assassins...wow!
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsTrophyTZeratul042/Line00010=Zeratul, wherever you are... I hope you're staying out of trouble.  
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsYbarra/Line00003=What's the word, man? 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsYbarra/Line00007=Gotta' grow eyes in the back of your head, chico.
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsYbarra/Line00008=You acting loco, homes. Go easy. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsYbarra/Line00009=Odale, poppy. 
Conversation/CantinaFidgetsYbarra/Line00010=Good to see you got your groove back, homes. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00003=I took a big chance with you and your Spectres, Tosh. I hope Nova wasn't right about you.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00004=Don't go believing that little girl's lies. The Spectre procedure affects everyone differently, but we're all still human. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00006=It's our choice whether to become Spectres - not hers, not yours and not Mengsk's. Choice be the only true freedom anyone gets.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00007=But can I trust 'em? Can I trust you?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00010=Don't you worry none. We'll fight for you right to the end. All my brothers and sisters - we owe you everything.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00011=(Chuckles) He's a bad, bad man that Tychus. He got a lot to hide.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00012=I heard about what went down in the lab. Pity that. But don't let yourself get distracted from what has to be done. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00013=Sometimes I feel like anything I start caring about... just gets destroyed.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00015=What do ya' think of Dr. Hanson?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00016=Not your fault. Did you ever stop and think what'd happen if all those refugees from Agria had gone to the core worlds? That Hanson was a honey trap right from the start. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00018=You think he's setting us up? His missions have been leading us straight to Kerrigan...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00019=Maybe you and Kerrigan keeping runnin' into each other because you both want the same thing? But Tychus - there's something else he don't want you to know. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00020=(beat) I can't see what. Just watch your back. Always remember that he's a force o' destruction that one... a stone killer.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00021=She's a lovely thing. Full o' honey, that one. At least that's what she want you to think.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00022=You think she's hiding something?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00023=You ever wonder why the zerg hit her world so fast? Something there they want. Something made o' honey maybe? Buzzin' little bees...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00024=I been keepin' my ear to the ground for you, and I hear a whisper. Seems Mengsk is plannin' to use alien technology to stop the zerg.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00033=Ah, here's my man. How can I be helping you, Mr. Raynor?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00040=Still don't trust me, brother? Until you decide, ain't nothing to discuss.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00041=You sit up here watching everything. Tell me what you see. Tychus just a mean drunk?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00042=You look... haunted. You've been seein' into the spirit world, and you learned somethin' you don't like. It's... Kerrigan?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00043=I saw... a hybrid. Something unnatural. It was trying to corrupt the protoss preservers. Who would have sent it there? Who controls something like that?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00044=But is it cast in stone? That's what I need to know.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00045=Who knows? I've heard you say we are who we choose to be. If that be true, the future cannot be fixed.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00046=Seems the Overmind made Kerrigan to... free the zerg... from somethin'. Put 'em on a collision course with the protoss.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00047=Zerg... protoss. These are strong races. How terrible - how powerful - is something that plays with their fates?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00048=It's all gone wrong. Everything's... twisted, and there's something out there that's set to destroy us all.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00054=I wish it was just that. All that jealousy and rage - he's fighting himself over something he don't want to do. You'll see. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00076=Had any... visitors... lately? 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00077=Oh I think you do, 'James Raynor'. Something was on this ship just now. (sniffs) I still smell it on you. (sniffs again) Protoss...interestin'...
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00078=Whatever you think you know, you just keep it to yourself. I hear you yappin' about this and I'll toss you out the airlock! 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00094=Good to see ya', brotha'. I been - wait. I can see it in your eyes. You've seen into the spirit world... The protoss. He gave you ... a crystal! And now you've been seein' what he's seen.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00095=That ain't nothing to do with you. Stay outta my head, Tosh!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00096=Have it your way. But you want to tread careful when you go lookin' into the beyond. If you need me, you know where I be.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00099=You look spooked. You've been seein' what the protoss has to show you. The memories shine through you as clear as day.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00101=The one that made them, for sure. That was just the first of many. Dark harbingers, man. Soon they'll be beyond numbering - an' the stars will weep at what comes after.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00102=How could you know all this?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00103=I don't. I just feel it be true. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00104=(amused) What've you been seein' this time, man? (sober) Wait...I see it too. Kerrigan?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00110=Damn, brotha' - you look like you could use a drink.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00111=I saw the last vision Zeratul put into the crystal. It was a look into the future - a final battle against the hybrid. Armageddon. Somehow... Kerrigan's the key to preventing it.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00112=Who knows how the wheel turns? Cycles upon cycles. This much I know - Those that see the future best take heed. It's both a gift... and a curse. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00115=So that's why he's collecting up artifacts!
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00116=Maybe. Could be why Kerrigan's chasing them too. She may not want them for herself, but she'll stop anyone else from getting to them.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00117=Take my advice - keep it simple. No attachments, no strings. Just you against the universe.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00126=Ever wonder why Mengsk don't just send him Ghosts to kill you? You've been a thorn in his side for a long time.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00127=Assassinating me'd just turn me into a martyr. (chuckles) He'd never be rid of me then. He needs to kill my reputation first. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00128=Very good. You think clearly despite your hate for him. 'Course his patience has got limits too. Tread careful, Mr. Raynor. Someone on this ship is already working for Mengsk. I can feel it. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00132=Whatever you found down there makes me afraid. What was it?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00133=Something monstrous - a zerg-protoss hybrid. It must've been a powerful psi for you to feel its scream from all the way up here. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00134=Searing. Blinding. Like feelin' the sun burning your face with your eyes squeezed shut. I never felt a thing like that before. I hope I never do again.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00135=Must be hard, man, seeing the Queen o' blades out in the world again. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00136=How much do you know about Kerrigan, Tosh?
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00137=I had some... friends in the Ghost Academy. That girl was a legend even before she disappeared from the program. There's a few that know the truth... how the Queen of Blades came to be. 
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00138=She's a creature of pure rage now.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00139=Oh yes - it's her or us. If we don't kill her she'll slaughter us all.
Conversation/CantinaTosh/Line00140=I don't know what you're talking about, Tosh.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00001=I gotta' know - just what was it went down between you and Mengsk? Seems you boys were tight once. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00002=I used to think Mengsk'd be a force for change. I fought alongside him right up until Tarsonis. That's where he crossed the line by using zerg to murder the whole planet. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00003=Nothin' says I can't do my part for humanity and get paid well for my trouble.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00004=Right.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00005=He left Kerrigan there to die 'cause she called him out on it. Turned out he was just as rotten as the Confederacy ever was.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00006=Damn. You sure know how to pick your friends, Jimmy. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00009=You meet Dr. Hanson yet?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00010=Sure did. I asked that sweet thing if she'd like to give me a physical. No harm in askin', right? I think she's got her eye on some pansy-ass though.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00013=Yeah? Who might that be?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00014=(sarcastic) Oh I dunno, some white knight kinda guy, came charging down to save her colony, maybe? Damn, Jimmy - you never could read the ladies.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00015=You ready to tell me what the hell that was all about?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00016=Man, these last few weeks... helpin' you fight the good fight - I finally got a taste of what real freedom is.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00017=Then what was all that talk earlier about doin' humanity a favor and getting paid well in the process?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00019=But that's all comin' to an end with you chargin' off like some damn hero - for a cause I couldn't care less about.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00020=Heh. You just let me know when I can take it out for another spin!
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00021=You ever heard of a guy named Gabriel Tosh?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00022=Robbing a train again get ya' feelin' nostalgic? 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00024=Only rumors. Way I hear it, he was mixed up in some covert branch of the Ghost program that produced some real scary bad-asses. Word was Tosh snapped and went rogue. I'd play it real cool with that kind. He'd cut your throat soon as look 'atcha.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00025=Your Moebius buddies ever happen to mention that the Queen of Blades wants these artifacts too?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00026=Hey, they just give me the missions, man. What's it matter anyway? Puttin' that bitch down would be doin' everyone a favor...
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00027=I've dealt with rogue Ghosts before. It's the ones still working for Mengsk I got a problem with.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00029=That Tosh is a whack job, Jimmy! Spends all his time muttering and playing around with those damn... dolls of his.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00030=Well, I need someone to balance out your sophistication and good manners.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00033=The guy ain't right in the head, brother! I can appreciate some good, honest craziness. But that guy? He's got something broke inside.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00035=So how does the Odin rate as a fighting machine?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00037=Brother... it is the single greatest creation in the history of mankind. Stridin' around and dispensin' righteous fury just about brought a tear to my eye. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00038=Damn straight. We musta hit the Shale Express a dozen times back in the day. (chuckles) [Happy] Ah, that caper never got old.[/Happy]
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00039=Almost got us killed when they smartened up and started using outriders to chase us.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00040=You'll get your chance soon enough, ol' buddy. Don't you worry.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00041=Never was a man of 'em could keep up with you on a Vulture, Jimmy. Just added to the fun. How the hell you got a job as marshal after all that I'll never know.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00042=That little Nova chick was somethin' else. You ever think about hittin' that, Jimmy?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00045=Damn shame Doc Hanson stayed behind. She was just about to fall for my roguish charms too. You ain't gonna tell me you weren't just a little bit tempted to stay with her, are ya?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00046=Heh. That girl's nothin' but trouble, Tychus. She's got her hands full hunting down the rest of Tosh's psychopathic Spectres. Best just to stay out of her way.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00047=That wasn't no answer. All these missed opportunities... There's something very wrong with you, man.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00050=I been down that road before, Tychus. I took my shot at a normal life a long time ago. Ain't no going back now. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00051=Huh. Couple of badasses like us ain't cut out for the quiet life anyway. Yes sir, destiny's got us pegged for something way bigger.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00053=Thought you'd want to hear - Tosh has officially thrown in with our little revolution. He's gonna lend us his Spectres to help out.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00054=You sure got a soft spot for wayward psychics, Jimmy. Settin' those freaks loose ain't smart. Ol' Mengsk had 'em locked up for a reason.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00055=Mengsk locked 'em up because they were just weapons to him. They deserve a shot at livin' their lives outside of a cage... just like anyone else.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00058=You gonna tell me 'I told ya so' - that we never shoulda gone to Agria in the first place?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00059=I ain't about to kick dirt on ya when yer down. Just some bad luck is all. Besides I'm sure your protoss buddies are real proud of you.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00060=It was our own mess to clean up. I don't give a damn what the protoss think.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00063=I thought it was just about the money with you, Tychus.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00067=How'd you become such good buddies with those freaky pro-toss? All I hear is they kill terrans like you and me on sight!
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00068=Some of 'em would. But some others would fight to the death protectin' people like us. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00071=I helped 'em defend their homeworld from the zerg during the first war. When Kerrigan came back leading the Swarm, I helped 'em out again. They're real big on loyalty.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00073=Damn Jimmy, almost sounds like you respect 'em. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00074=I wouldn't expect you to understand, Tychus. 
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00075='Just seems the closer we get to your Queen of Blades... well, let's just say things don't always work out the way ya' plan, Jimmy.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00079=I need ya with me on this one, Tychus. Trust me... for old times' sake.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00080=Alright. Alright, I'm with ya.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00082=That's my boy.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00083=Old times...
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00085=They got their hands full right now. The zerg are about to invade Tyrador where Moebius' main research center is. I don't reckon we'll hear anything from them until they relocate somewhere safe.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00086=Wonderful.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00087=So now we've got three of these artifacts on my ship! When are we supposed to hand these damn things over?
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00088=Well that's gonna be a bit tricky. I hear the zerg've attacked the Moebius research center on Tyrador. I don't get it though. What's the Queen of Blades after? Ain't no artifacts there.
Conversation/CantinaTychus/Line00089=If those eggheads can't hold out till we get there, we may never know. Upload the data to the star map. Looks like we've got ourselves a good ol' fashioned rescue mission. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00001=Was that thing the real reason you went back to Mar Sara, Jim?
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00002=Now that's good drinkin' music!
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00003=Yeah, yeah, I'm still working on it.
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00004=Keep it down, ya damn hippy. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00005=Ain't right how much you love that thing. A man can't afford any attachments he ain't prepared to walk out on.
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00006=A good bar ain't nothin' without good tunes. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00007=Little jukebox... you're the only one that understands me. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00008=It was a real bitch installing that thing up there. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00009=Play some Freebird! I love that one!
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00010=What is that, 'freedom rock'? 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00011=I'm in the mood for something jazzy, hermano. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00012=Hey, homes  you got any love songs in there? (beat) Hey, don't look at me that way! 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsJukebox/Line00013=C'mon keep it low, man. I can barely hear myself think.
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00002=Felt good helpin' folks rebuild their lives. Guess we could all use a fresh start from time to time. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00003=You did a real good thing helpin' those folks on Haven. Ah, damnit  I'm gettin' all misty-eyed. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00004=(earnest) Wonder if we'll ever see those folks from Haven again? (Beat) I mean, I heard they had a great recipe for Dylarian Gravity Shots.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00005=I miss Ariel. She sure livened this place up. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00006=I was thinking 'bout jumping ship and staying on Haven. I dunno.... Peace and tranquility make me too nervous, know what I'm sayin'?
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03A2/Line00007=Look at you, helpin' those people. You just a big softie, homes. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00001=Damn the zerg for infesting that colony... And damn the protoss for being right about it!
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00002=Makes me sick just thinkin' about what we did on Haven. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00003=Ah, Ariel... I'm so sorry. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00004=We did what we had to do... But I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00005=Don't beat yourself up. It was a no-win situation. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00006=You win some, you lose some. Ain't often a man does both at once. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00007=That colony had to be purged. Still, the protoss owe you one. It'd be nice to have some of those zealots on the payroll.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHanson03B/Line00008=You did the right thing. I bet, given the same situation, you would have made the same choice all over again. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00003=That Tychus is loco. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00004=Now that was a sight to see. Giant metal monster destroying a city... They should make a movie out of that. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00005=You know Tychus downed two full bottles of tequila before he got strapped into the Odin? I don't know how he could even function after that.
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00006=Your buddy Tychus would have made an excellent pilot. Or a circus performer, can't decide which. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00007=Heck of a joyride, Tychus.
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00008=Haw, one of the great days of my life. (beat) Like I always say, monster cannons and giant crushing feet always bring out the best in me.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTHorner04/Line00009=(laughs)
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00001=Biggest jailbreak ever. Hell of a thing.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00002=Nothin' like a good old-fashioned jailbreak. Well, guess there was nothin' old-fashioned about it... 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00003=We released some good folks back into the world. Here's to hopin' they give Mengsk a real hard time.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00004=I did some time in New Folsom. You just set a lot of my homies free, man. They all owe you big time.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00005=I'll die before I ever let 'em lock me away.  
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00006=Someday, they'll rebuild that place. Figure they'll have an extra special cell waiting for you, homes. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00007=Nice job cracking New Folsom. There's going to be a lot of mercenaries back on the market now. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00008=Some jailbreak. You're one crazy bastard, I ever tell you that?
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00009=My brothers and sisters owe you a debt we can never fully repay. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00010=Long as they keep Mengsk in their cross-hairs, we'll call it even. 
Conversation/CantinafidgetsTrophyTTosh03A/Line00011=Oh, they will. They'll make him pay for what he did to us - one way or another. 
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00001=Thought I left this behind on Mar Sara! How did...Tychus! Just can't let it go, can ya.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00002=Funny. Sometimes I still feel like a cop. Only now it's the bad guys that are in charge. 
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00003=I should really take this down. Guess the crew thinks it's cool or somethin'...
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00004=I could hardly believe it when I heard you used to be a Marshal. Makes sense, I guess. 
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00005=You always get this haunted look when you stare at that thing, Jim. Have a drink and forget all about it.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00006=Man, you were practically a legend back in the day. You busted a few of my cousins once  but I don't hold a grudge or nothin'.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00007=Bad-ass Marshal, huh? Any other 'career paths' you ain't told us about, homes?
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00008=You still have any contacts in law enforcement? Can't hurt to network, know what I mean?
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsbadge/Line00009=Ever think about it, Jim? What justice really means to you now?
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00001=These 'miners' are a real bunch of hardasses.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00002=These boys are a good crew.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00003=Worth the credits, they use top-of-the-line gear.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00004=Don't let 'em fight sober.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00005=These guys'll do anything for money.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00006=That contract's a bargain!
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00007=Don't let 'em give you any backtalk.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00008=That's a serious chunk of firepower.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00009=Have guns, will travel.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00010=If ya like your critters done crispy, these are your guys.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00011=H-Sec'll bring the hammer down alright.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00012=These guys are new, they reckon they're the bomb.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00013=Hard times for this crew right now.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00014=No merchants to rob so now they gotta work for a living.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00015=Hard to believe that ship's still going.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00016=You knew General Duke, right?
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00017=Check back with me when you've earned more money. I'll have new merc contracts ready for you by then.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetsmercs/Line00018=Just remember these contracts may look pricey but they're long term. Once you hire a mercenary they're yours until the war's over - hell they'll even replace their own losses between missions!
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00001=You sure like your trophies, Jimmy.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00002=Not me, but the boys do get a kick out of 'em.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00004=Those old claws're looking lonely up there, I oughta get some new stuff.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00005=Ok, they ain't the biggest claws I ever saw but we couldn't fit those on the damn wall.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00006=Why's everyone so keen on nailing up bits of zerg around the place? I don't get it.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00007=We're gonna be facing a whole lot more zerg before we're through.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00008=That was a good kill, homes.
Conversation/Cantinafidgetstrophyclaws/Line00009=I know collectors that'd pay good money for those.
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00001=Watch the flanks! 
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00002=Reloading!
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00003=Come on, bring it!
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00004=Medic! Medic!
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00005=Take it bitches!
Conversation/CharAmbient/Line00006=Need more ammo here!
Conversation/CharFidgetsArtifact/Line00001=We spent a lot of time huntin' down all them pieces. Now 'it's all together, this thing gives me the willies somethin' awful. 
Conversation/CharFidgetsArtifact/Line00002=I know what you mean. When I look at it, it's... it's like I can hear voices in my head... Sooner we're done with this thing, the better. 
Conversation/CharFidgetsArtifact/Line00003=Agreed. Right now this artifact is the most important weapon in the universe and we're going to use it.
Conversation/CharFidgetsArtifact/Line00004=I just wish the damn thing came with an instruction manual. For all we know we could be upsettin' the entire space-time continuum! 
Conversation/CharFidgetsArtifact/Line00005=Easy, Tychus. This ain't science fiction. 
Conversation/CharFidgetsRaynor/Line00005=Never thought I'd come back to this hell hole.
Conversation/CharFidgetsRaynor/Line00006=The ash and lava hide all the blood that's been spilled here.
Conversation/CharFidgetsRaynor/Line00008=We're a long way from the nearest bar.
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00001=(yelling) Lock and load, Jimmy-boy! (BLAM! BLAM!) These blasted critters just keep comin'! (BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!) What we got here's the biggest turkey shoot in the galaxy!
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00002=Hate to spoil all your fun, Tychus - (BLAM! BLAM!) but we gotta start pushing toward the primary hive cluster, pronto! 
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00003=That's a tall order, ol' buddy! 'Tween them Nydus worms on the ground and that swarm of fliers overhead, we ain't in no position to push against anything!
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00004=Yer' always an inspiration, Tychus. 
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00005=Final push. You ready for this?
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00006=That I am, partner. Hell, we're gonna be the guys that kill the Queen of Blades! Genuine heroes! Ol' Mengsk might even give you a pardon!
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00007=(threatening) Get one thing straight, Tychus - if Valerian's right and this artifact can turn Kerrigan human again, I'm taking her away from this place. You hear what I'm sayin'?
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00008=I hear ya' Jimmy, and I know you wanna believe she can come back. But after all the misery she's caused... well, let's just say... some folks don't deserve second chances. 
Conversation/CharTychus/Line00009=I'll be the judge of that.  
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00001=How're you holdin' up, General?
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00002=[Angry]Ahh....Damn poison. I told those pansy-ass medics to lop off my arm so I could get back to the front. [/Angry]Even so, I'm in pretty bad shape. I've decided to hand over all command to you.
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00003=I understand. I know that ain't easy for you. 
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00004=[Happy]Easy? (chuckles) Son... I'm getting' off easy compared to what you got ahead of you. [/Happy]To reach the main hive, you'll have to choose... between taking out their ground reinforcements or their air support. There ain't time for both...
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00005=Don't worry, General. I'll deal with the zerg. First chance you get, head back to the ship and get patched up. That's an order.
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00007=All these years, Mengsk made you out to be the devil himself. But I've seen you put it on the line for men who'd otherwise be hunting you down.  
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00008=Your Emperor's the one 'should be brought to justice. All I ever wanted was for folks to live free. 
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00009=Charging into battle with a stranger - taking enemy fire, holding the line shoulder to shoulder - that's the great equalizer of war. It's an honor to fight at your side.
Conversation/CharWarfield/Line00010=I sure do appreciate that, General.

Conversation/CommunicatorUnlocked/Line00001=Sir, We're receiving a transmission from the Bucephalus. Prince Valerian's holding on the communicator for you. 
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00001=...and in other news today, Emperor Arcturus Mengsk held a press conference commemorating the end of the so-called Brood War some four years ago. Our own Kate Lockwell was on the scene.
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00002=Emperor, the threat of a new zerg invasion is still very real - but instead of expanding our fleets, you've squandered trillions on hunting down has-been rebels like Jim Raynor! 
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00003=(irritated) Jim Raynor represents a clear and present threat to this Dominion! He is an unscrupulous, lawless revolutionary bent on spreading fear and dissention across the sector! He and his ragtag band of miscreants have instigated open rebellion across six separate worlds - and stolen vast amounts of Dominion weapons and hardware!
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00005=Adjutant, are my troops ready yet?
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00006=(confident, bad-ass) It ain't over till it's over, you son of a bitch. 
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00009=Your forces are prepared and awaiting your orders, Commander. Uploading tactical data now.
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00010=Good. 'Bout time we kicked this revolution into overdrive.
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00011=He'll pay for what he did to both of us...
Conversation/CutsceneT01Raynorintro/Line00012=I assure you, this criminal will be brought to justice... very soon.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00001=James Raynor...
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00002=...I bring tidings of doom.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00003=Zeratul...
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00004=I have pierced the veil of the future and beheld only... oblivion.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00005=Yet one spark of hope remains. You will hold her life in your hands...
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00006=...And though justice demands that she die for her crimes, only she can save us.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00007=Wait a second, you're talking about Kerrigan?
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00008=Time is short! You must understand!
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00009=It's been four years! Y'show up outta nowhere -

Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00011=The answers you seek lie within. Study it well, the fate of creation hangs in the balance.
Conversation/CutsceneT03Zeratulswarning/Line00012=...Nice to see you too.

Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00004=(sarcastic) Nice suit. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00005=Pays to be prepared. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00006=I heard they put you on ice. Life sentence. (sarcastic) What, did they give you time off for good behavior?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00007=That's right, old buddy. I'm a model citizen now. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00008=(laughs) So to what do I owe the pleasure?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00009=Just a friendly business proposition. Do you even know what the Dominion are doing out here?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00010=I'm guessin' yer about to tell me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00011=Digging up alien artifacts, old buddy. Your boy Mengsk has gone crazy for 'em. But I got a contact that'll pay top dollar for every artifact we...liberate from the Dominion.
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00012=I guess I can hardly pass that up, now can I, Tychus?
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00013=Partners then. Sixty-forty. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00014=Seventy-thirty. My way. 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00015=(laughs) Feels like old times already! 
Conversation/CutsceneT04ABTychusIntro/Line00016=Old Times. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00001=Damn Jimmy, you've been holding out on me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00002=Cuttin it pretty close there, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00003=Never left you hanging before, sir. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00004=Fair enough. Just get us the hell outta here! 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00005=All batteries, concentrate forward firepower.  Spin up drives two and six!  All hands brace for warp jump on my mark!
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00008=Mark! 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00009=What the hell happened? We ain't seen the zerg in years  - why attack Mar Sara now? 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00010=It's not just Mar Sara. You need to see this. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00011=-Zerg swarm launched a full scale attack-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00012=-Devastation spread throughout all outer rim planets-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00013=-Sustained heavy losses-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00014=-Casualties in the billions-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00015=-Minutes ago the zerg attacked a Dominion military research facility-
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00016=Sweet mother of mercy. 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00017=-New, exclusive video footage confirms the Queen of Blades is in fact leading the swarm!
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00018=We always knew she'd be back. (beat) But what's she after? 
Conversation/CutsceneT05HornerBridgeIntro/Line00019=She's come to finish the job. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00001=Sir, we've reached the rendezvous coordinates. No contacts. Looks like the Moebius ship hasn't arrived yet.   
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00002=That's strange. It ain't like them to be late. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00003=Sir! Dominion ships warping in! Mengsk's flagship is leading them! 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00004=Sweet mother of mercy. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00005=Matt - pull us alongside and prep docking tubes! 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00006=Commander, this is not a smart move. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00007=You wanted your revolution, kid. Now ya got it. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00008=Turn around, Arcturus! I want you to see this coming. 
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00009=You won't find my father here, Commander. I am Valerian Mengsk - and I own the Moebius Foundation... through them, I own you as well.
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00010=Tell me why I shouldn't kill you right now...
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00011=Because I can offer you what you've always wanted -- a chance to rescue Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/CutsceneT06ValerianIntro/Line00012=Sir, their shields are still down. (decisive) I don't like this.
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00001=You boys gotta wake up! Raynor sold us out! I joined this outfit to fight the Dominion, not work for 'em!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00002=Everybody simmer down! We trusted the commander before - we should trust him now! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00003=(drunk)  You can't trust that drunk. Jim Raynor's nothing but a spineless coward!  
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00004=You been nothin' but poison since you got on this crate. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00005=That right!? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00006=Pathetic. Only person you can trust is yourself! The sooner you peons figure that out-- 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00007='Heard about enough of this!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00008=Aaah! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00009=You got 'em all fooled, don't ya, Jimmy? But the first sign of trouble - you'll just duck and run. It's what you do ain't it? Me... them... that pretty little girlfriend of yours... 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00010=Raaaaawr! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00012=Don't do something you're gonna regret, Tychus! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00013=Rawr!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00014=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00015=That.... Ain't... fair...
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00016=You think he's right? That I'm just gonna run out on ya? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00017=You've got us working for the Dominion now, Commander. Taking us back to Char? It's like you're gone already. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00018=This ain't about the Dominion. Our war's always been about savin' lives. If the zerg wipe everyone out, it's all been for nothing. So I'm going to back to Char. If you're with me, it's your choice. Just like it's always been. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00019=Now that's the commander I've been waiting on. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00020=(to crew) Satisfied? 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00021=Let's get back to work, boys. 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00022=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00023=I don't wanna have to have this conversation again. (beat) And fix my damn jukebox! 
Conversation/CutsceneT07BarFight/Line00024=Uhh... a little help here? ...Anybody...? 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00001=So I guess this is goodbye, Doc. I know you got a lot of cleaning up to do out there. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00002=We'll manage somehow. I just hope you boys stay out of trouble. Those protoss are bound to be upset. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00003=Well, me and the protoss go way back. I've helped them out a few times... Figure they might cut me some slack. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00004=You know, you could always stay here. Settle down, make a new start... 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00005=(laughs) Guys like me don't get second chances, darlin'. We just gotta finish what we begun.  
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00006=You're a good man, Jim Raynor. 
Conversation/CutsceneT08HansonAend/Line00007=Hmph. I ain't that good. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00001=Fifty years and no-one's ever escaped from New Folsom... but we broke it open in an afternoon. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00002=I can hardly believe we pulled it off. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00003=You guys did good. Now me and my spectres'll finish the job, we'll kill Mengsk and burn his Dominion to the ground. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00004=Overthrowing Mengsk is just the start. This is about building a better tomorrow. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00005=Don't you see? We just released every scientist, philosopher, and free thinker that ever challenged Mengsk's rule. That was our real victory today.
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00006=You really that naive? Tomorrow there'll be a new Mengsk and another one after that. Your great, shining dream of the future is just an illusion. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00007=So if it's all so bleak why are you here, Tosh? What do you get out of all this? 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00008=Same thing as you, brother! I don't quit till Mengsk is dead. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00009=Vengeance doesn't factor into this. Our revolution's about freedom. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00010=You'll see that better future, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT09ToshAend/Line00011=But it ain't for the likes of us. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00008=I've been cleaning up after you a lot lately. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00009=Leave it alone, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00010=Same dream? 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00011=I said leave it alone. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00012=What happened to Kerrigan wasn't your fault...
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00013=Which part? Where she got left behind, [Angry]or where she murdered eight billion people.[/Angry]
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00014=Same old bullshit. You ain't going to listen. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00015=Man, do you even see what you're becoming? 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00016=We are who we chose to be, Matt. 
Conversation/CutsceneT10RaynorsDream/Line00017=When you figure it out let us know. We're waitin' on ya. 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00001=Ruah!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00002=Oof!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00003=Huh-ah.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00004=General. You know I've always got a card to play. 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00005=Huah!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00006=You might be a damn pirate, Raynor, but whatever happens you saved my boys today and I won't forget that.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00007=All in a day's work, General.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00008=Shit!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00009=Ungh!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00010=Ungh!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00015=Aaah!
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00016=Gah! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00018=- Fall back! - We're cut off! - 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00019=Belay that order! Stand your ground! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00021=Huff! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00024=Grah. 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00025=Ain't no time to be lyin' down on the job, General.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00026=(chuckles) Heard you boys needed some help. We came as fast as we could.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00027=You magnificent son of a bitch! You're the last man I expected to see! 
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00028=Boys...I hate to interrupt but...the natives are gettin' restless.
Conversation/CutsceneT11Charbattlefield/Line00029=Thanks for the rescue...But I hope it ain't just the two of you...
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00001=Y'know I love seeing him squirm, but the Dominion's just going to spin this like they do everything else.
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00002=Not this time. Mengsk used the media as a weapon for years, and now we've turned it against him. One broadcast and it won us a bigger victory than a hundred battles. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00004=I guess you're right, well it's what we started this revolution for in the first place....We've got a long way to go, but maybe we started something here. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00005=Hearts and minds man, just like you always said. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00006=Y'know Matt, someday you're going to wind up leading this bunch of misfits. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00007=Oh, no... that's what I keep you around for...sir. 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00008=....these shocking revelations...
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00009=...of anti-Mengsk sentiment...
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00010=... the Emperor held a news conference earlier today: 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00011=Emperor - how do you respond to these allegations of genocide! Of using aliens to-- 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00012= I assure you, these slanderous attacks against the throne are baseless and irresponsible!
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00013=Sir, do you still stand by the sentiment that selfless devotion to the people is the basis of your rule?
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00014=Well, of course! I was called upon to serve the greater interest of humanity! Personal power was never my goal!
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00015=Then how would you characterize this statement?
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00016=...I will not be stopped. Not by you or the Confederates or the protoss or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me....
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00017=(roars) I...I won't STAND for this! You jackals think you can come in here and question ME?! This interview is OVER! 
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00018={Laughs}
Conversation/CutsceneT12HornerVictory/Line00019={Laughs}
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00001=Ariel! You in here? 
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00002=Matt, seal all access points.
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00003=Rawr!  
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00004=Oh, God - not you, too... 
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00005=Will you enjoy killing me ...like you killed my children?
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00007=You're infested...You're dead already.
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00008=Do... it... finish... it...  
Conversation/CutsceneT13HansonBend/Line00011=Will you enjoy it?
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00001=Transmission coming in - it's Tosh. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00002=Didn't take long for him to gloat, patch him through. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00003=You gonna pay for that man - 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00004=Is that supposed to be me? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00005=- you gonna regret crossing me... 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00006=Ugh!
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00007=Huh? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00008=You're a scumbag Tosh - 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00009= - I've spent my whole life fighting men like you. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00010=Aaaahh!
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00011=Hah, you and me, we're just the same. We'd both do anything to get the job done. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00012=No. You don't get it at all. And now you never will.
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00013=What you gonna do man? I'm six light years away! 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00014=Not me...
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00015=Hmm. Cold and efficient. Reminds me of someone I used to know. Glad you're not after me. 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00016=Not today anyway - I'll see you around Jim.
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00017=Don't you ever meet any normal girls? 
Conversation/CutsceneT14ToshBend/Line00018=Aaaahh!
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00001=That's funny, convict, I don't recall giving you access to our database. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00002=Just keeping up on current events, 'Captain'.  Seems this 'Queen of Blades' got everybody running scared. She don't look so tough.
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00004=You have no idea who she is, do you, Tychus? 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00005=Don't matter to me none. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00006=Well it matters to Jim. They were...close once. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00007=Wait a minute...(chuckles) you're tellin' me they  were shacked up?! 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00008=(sighs) Apparently she was something else... before the zerg took her. Turned her into that.
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00009=And Jimmy feels responsible. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00010=Honestly, if we have to face her again I don't know what he'll do. 
Conversation/CutsceneT15KerriganIntro/Line00011=Woman like that...there's only one thing to do. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00001=Char. If Hell ever existed - this is it. Oceans of fire, tectonic storms and an atmosphere that'll burn a man alive. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00002=But we've planned for all of that- 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00003=You can't plan for the zerg, general. They ain't goin' to fit in to your nice, clean time table. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00004=I've led five separate invasions against the swarm. I held the line while you and your terrorist friends hid under a rock.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00005=We're all aware of your victories, General. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00006=I've invited Commander Raynor here to assist us with any unforeseen contingencies. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00007=Well it sounds like you got it all figured out, junior. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00008=I have far too much invested in this undertaking to see it fail.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00009=Valerian! I've just received a report you've taken half the fleet! Care to explain yourself, boy? 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00010=Father, I am about to accomplish that which you never could. Today I will defeat the Queen of Blades and secure peace throughout the Dominion. By this act the people will finally know that I am a worthy successor to you. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00011=I love your gumption, son, but you're in way over your head. What makes you think you have the experience to- 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00012=He ain't alone, Arcturus! 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00013=[Surprise]Raynor. [/Surprise]I don't know what gutter my son fished you out of, but even you've got to realize that treacherous bitch cannot be saved... And neither can you.  
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00014=We'll see about that, and when this is over, you and me got a score to settle. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00016=Everything I could have hoped for... 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00017=You're playing a dangerous game here, kid - 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00018=Prince Valerian, we have zerg attack waves incoming. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00019=Already? 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00020=Clear the bridge! I've got a battle to win.
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00021=I'll see you boys on the ground. 
Conversation/CutsceneT16Charinvasion/Line00022=Speaking of which, you might particularly enjoy this next step.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00001=Good to see you on your feet general. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00002=Well, we'll see how long that lasts. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00003=Heh.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00004=I brought you boys a present. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00005=The Xel'Naga artifact's been assembled. I hope to God it does what we think it does. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00006=Damn straight. Bettin' our asses on some alien piece of crap don't sit right with me.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00007=I hear ya, Tychus. But if I was bankin' everything on that I'd be quit already. 'Cause here we are in the mouth of hell, an' we made it this far by leanin' on each other.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00008=Whether it's blind luck or damn-fool courage - in all my years, I've never seen anything like what you two jokers have pulled off.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00009=That thing may be the key to stopping the Queen of Blades - but it's our sweat and blood that'll make it happen. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00010=After everything we've been through, past all the fire and fury...
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00011=...the one thing I know - is that we can count on each other to get the job done. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00012=Or die trying, if that's what it takes.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00014=...because some things are just worth fighting for. 
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00015=Good to see you in one piece, General.
Conversation/CutsceneT17CharbattlefieldB/Line00016=Well...almost in one piece.
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00001=Sarah
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00002=You readin' all this?
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00003=(over the radio) You have your orders, Mr. Findlay. Carry them out. 
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00004=It's okay. I gotcha.
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00005=Tychus...what have you done? 
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00006=I made a deal with the devil, Jimmy. She dies. I go free. 
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00007=We all got our choices to make...
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00008='Damn shame... 
Conversation/DeZergified/Line00009=Jim?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00001=Well, I like this guy already. Just the same, we'd best keep an eye on him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00002=Well, old girl, we dug you up on Tarsonis. Were you online during the zerg attack? You remember anything about Arcturus Mengsk bein' involved? 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00003=Mengsk. Arcturus. Ex-Confederate officer. Civilian Prospector. Founder and leader of the Sons of Korhal terrorist group. Status. Criminal.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00004=And you were gonna tell me all this when?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00009=Now Mengsk hates him almost as much as he hates you.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00010=You're the only man who's been close to her and lived to tell the tale. You know her tactics, you know her strategies - and I know you'd risk anything for the chance to bring her back.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00012=Sir, tell me you're not seriously considering this deal with Valerian!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00013=Sounds like a golden deal to me, Jimmy. Kerrigan turns human, takes a bullet between the eyes... You can put your past to rest and still make one hell of a payday!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00014=Nice work, sir. The payoff from Redstone really got us back on our feet.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00015=Let's not get ahead of ourselves, Tychus...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00016=Accessing intercepted transmission 0081 to 0086 Alpha.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00017=Why is that Tosh guy aboard?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00018=He wanted to talk to you in person, sir. Something about conducting more 'business ventures' together.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00019=You do any diggin' on him?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00020=Of course, and he's no pirate. Rumor has it he's a renegade Ghost - and until he vanished he was one of the Dominion's top assassins.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00021=Great to have ya', Doc. How you plannin' on pitchin' in?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00022=Great job, sir. Dr. Hanson's offered to stay on with us for now and I think her skills will be invaluable.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00023=Well, your medical facilities are medieval and your science expertise is non-existent. Perhaps I could start there?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00024=[Sad 90]Ouch.[/Sad] Well I guess you might be able to teach Stetmann a thing or two. Welcome aboard, Doc.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00025=It's hard to believe I'm even here.  
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00028=This is Duke. The Emitters are secured and online.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00029=Who authorized the use of Psi Emitters?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00030=I did, Lieutenant.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00031=Sir, I received an encrypted transmission from an untraceable source.  It claims that Tosh here was part of a classified operation called Project: Shadowblade. They used jorium and terrazine to enhance ghost powers.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00032=There's no telling what the zerg will throw against us this time. Sir, we need to make sure our hardware and munitions are up to the challenge.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00033=Yeah, I'll check in with Swann down in the armory. Knowin' him, he's already got upgrades for us. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00035=Even if that were possible, she holes up in the main hive cluster on Char - protected by a billion screaming zerg. How're you going to get that thing anywhere near her?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00036=Welcome back, sir. Glad you're still alive. Prince Valerian's been trying to contact you. You can reach him over the communicator. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00038=Well, you fought real good out there, Tychus. Your time in the freezer didn't dull your edge none. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00039=Well, fear and violence always did bring out the best in me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00040=Have to admit, we always did make a good team.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00041=Yeah, well - that was until I went to prison... and you went legit.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00042=Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00043=What? The Confederates on Antiga were bad enough, but now you're going to use the zerg against an entire planet? This is insane.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00044=She's right, man. Think this through. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00045=I have thought it through, believe me. You all have your orders. Carry them out.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00046=I will not be stopped. Not by you or the Confederates or the protoss or anyone! I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00047=Holy... I can't believe it! We can nail Mengsk to the wall with this!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00049=Talk to me, you old piece of junk. What do you know?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00050=User identified. Raynor. James. Ex-marshal, Mar Sara colony. Joined. Sons of Korhal terrorist group. Status. Criminal.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00051=Enough about me, darlin'. What else you got locked up in that synthetic head of yours?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00052=User status. Criminal. Access denied.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00053=Playin' hard to get, huh? We'll see about that. 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00054=Assaulting Char is a suicide mission! You'd be putting all our lives on the line just to get your girlfriend back!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00055=This is bigger than all of us, Matt!  It ain't about me. This is the only real chance we're ever gonna' get. And I'm takin' it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00056=So which is it gonna be, Jimmy? We bringin' Kerrigan back... or puttin' her in the ground?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00057=That's for me to decide. (beat) You've both got a lot of prep work to do -- get to it!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00058=I hate to ask, sir -- but is there a reason that convict's still on my bridge?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00059=Easy, Matt. Tychus is one of my oldest friends. He helped me out of a real bind a few years back. I owe him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00060=Well your friend has a criminal record as long as...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00061=Mine? Believe me, if Tychus Findlay wanted me dead, I'd be dead already.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00062=(Not liking it) Understood, sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00063=I caught Tychus hacking into our database, sniffing around about Kerrigan. I don't know what his game is, but we clearly can't trust him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00064=Matt, me an' Tychus ran together a long time -- got into all sorts of trouble. When the law finally caught up, he took the rap for both of us. Never once ratted me out. (beat) I got a second chance, he got locked up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00065=I understand your loyalty, sir, but ---
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00066=I owe him, Matt. Leave it be.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00067=Yes Sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00068=Yes sir.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00069=Sir, that adjutant we recovered is down in the lab. She's all powered up.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00070=Sir, the decrypted adjutant is back in the lab, and ready to go.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00071=Nova transmitted the Ghost training specs to us sir. We should be able to field our own Ghosts now.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00072=If Mengsk finds out, she's gonna have some explainin' to do.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00073=I think she can cover her tracks. That's what Ghosts do, right?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00074=That, and cut people's throats.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00075=Right.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00076=Friend Raynor, you now bear witness... to the truth. There is a malevolent presence within the Void that seeks to destroy everything we hold dear. Could this... Fallen One be a Xel'Naga? After so long... could the gods themselves seek our destruction?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00077=And Kerrigan... I can hardly believe -- the wretched Queen of Blades will prevent the destruction of all that we know...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00078=Raynor, you may soon hold Kerrigan's fate in your hands. I know only that she must live. Be wary, old friend... the hounds of the Void... are on the hunt.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00079=It's true. We are called Spectres -- next generation Ghosts.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00080=We all have our secrets, Mr. Raynor.  Doesn't mean I'm any threat to you.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00081=[Angry 50]Maybe not -- but whoever sent this message could be.[/Angry] Matt, any way to verify the transmission?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00082=No sir. But it does end with "I'll be in touch soon."
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00083=It's Mengsk - trying to turn us against each other. Don't let him.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00084=I'll let it lie for now -- at least 'til I find out who sent this transmission. But I'll be keeping an eye on you, Tosh.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00085=Well Ariel, found a world for your people yet?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00086=Yes! An unclaimed planet called Haven. It's near the edge of protoss space, but it seems safe enough.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00087=It'll have to do. Your people need to lay low for a while.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00088=Aren't either of you worried the colonists might be infested?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00089=You can try.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00090=How could you even suggest that? They're perfectly healthy!
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00091=I hope so, Ariel. The protoss don't mess around when it comes to infestation. Just in case, maybe you should start looking into some kind of cure for the zerg virus.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00092=Conventional wisdom says a cure is impossible -- the virus mutates too fast. But I'll look into it.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00093=Just do what you can. That's all anyone's askin'.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00094=That thing down there, it was like the hybrid Zeratul fought.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00095=Here? But how?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00096=(ranting) Mengsk! It's always Mengsk! The end of the universe is coming and I should have known he'd be behind it! 
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00097=But how did he hybridize zerg and protoss? The technology required is way beyond anything terrans have developed. He can't be working alone on this...
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00098=What the hell is Mengsk playing at?
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00099=Creating his own alien super-soldiers by the looks of it. He's found a way to hybridize zerg and protoss somehow.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00100=Don't look like he's house-broken 'em yet. Least the lab's been trashed.
Conversation/Debriefs/Line00101=Yeah, but it was only one lab. Who's to say how many more he's set up?
Conversation/FixedCondition/Credits=Credits between ~VALUE01~ and ~VALUE02~
Conversation/FixedCondition/MissionAvailable=~INDEX~ available (skipped ~VALUE01~ to ~VALUE02~ times)
Conversation/FixedCondition/MissionCompleted=~INDEX~ completed (did ~VALUE01~ to ~VALUE02~ missions ago)
Conversation/FixedCondition/MissionCompletedCount=Completed ~VALUE~ missions
Conversation/FixedCondition/MissionLast=Last mission was ~INDEX~
Conversation/FixedCondition/TechPurchased=~INDEX~ purchased
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00001=We sure gave Mengsk a kick in the pants! Excuse me, I don't usually have outbursts like that.
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00002=The Dominion is getting into some pretty advanced weapons technology. But their biological sciences are still terrible.
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00003=I don't like that Nova. I wonder how many people she's killed?
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00004=Be careful Jim. I think you're losing yourself in that crystal.
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00005=Valerian is... interesting. He's confident, but has he ever gotten his hands dirty?
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00006=You're close to finishing this. You sure you're ready for it?
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00007=That was a rough mission. I can't believe you got the artifact!
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00008=I can't believe those Dominion scientists were hybridizing zerg and protoss! That's just... madness!
Conversation/HansonPissedLines/Line00009=I don't suppose you could give me a sample of your brain tissue for study purposes?
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00001=If Mira Han calls I'm... I'm just busy.
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00002=I don't know what Mengsk was trying to do in that lab. But I think he's in over his head.
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00004=You might want to talk to our new guest. Maybe ask him to leave my bridge?
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00005=Better future. Let's hope that's what Ariel's people find on Haven.
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00006=I won't expect any gratitude from Nova. But I think we did the right thing by getting rid of Tosh.
Conversation/HornerPissedLines/Line00007=I'm... sorry about Ariel, sir. You really didn't have a choice.
Conversation/HyperionHorneridles/Line00001=Could be worth taking a look at the battlereport console, sir. 
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00001=Home sweet home.
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00002=I should go for a walk outside... oh wait.
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00004=Standin' around talking to my damn self... 
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00006=That's it. Goin' to have to start pretendin' like I'm workin'. 
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00007=Ahh, I like all the pretty lights. 
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00008=Revolution's a little slow today. 
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00009=This old crate needs an overhaul.
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00010=I'm gettin' too damn old for this.
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00011=What the hell was I doing?
Conversation/HyperionfidgetsRaynor/Line00012=Time for a bold, unstoppable plan.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00001=Centuries ago four prison ships from Earth veered off course and journeyed deep into the remote Koprulu sector. There they crash-landed on the planets of Tarsonis, Moria, and Umoja.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00002=Cut off from Earth, the survivors established colonies throughout the sector. The largest, Tarsonis, was founded by a powerful yet increasingly oppressive government called the Confederacy.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00003=Spurred by the terrible acts of this government, Arcturus Mengsk formed the Sons of Korhal. This rebel army fought to overthrow the Confederacy and liberate the Koprulu sector.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00004=Even as Mengsk and his resistance fighters fought to overthrow the corrupt Confederacy, a much greater threat confronted the terrans.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00005=Without warning, massive alien warships appeared and surrounded the Confederate planet of Chau Sara. Calling themselves protoss, the aliens incinerated the planet's surface and then mysteriously withdrew.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00006=The planet had been infested by another type of alien: the zerg. These monstrous creatures threatened to overwhelm terran space, and the protoss sought to eradicate them before they spread.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00007=The zerg had already reached the neighboring planet, Mar Sara, and Marshal Jim Raynor fought to save the terrified colonists as the Confederate government abandoned them to the alien menace.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00008=The Sons of Korhal intervened, saving thousands of lives from the rampaging zerg and enigmatic protoss. Disgusted by the Confederacy, Raynor joined the rebels and met Sarah Kerrigan.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00009=Kerrigan was a former Confederate ghost operative, and she shared Raynor's desire for a liberated Koprulu sector. They grew close as the battle with the Confederacy escalated.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00010=But Mengsk went too far in his hatred and ambition. He ordered devices placed on the Confederate capital world of Tarsonis to lure the zerg and annihilate the population.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00011=The protoss, led by Executor Tassadar, decided to help the Terrans defeat the zerg instead of purging the planet of life. Mengsk sent Kerrigan to stop Tassadar's interference.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00012=With Kerrigan battling the protoss, the zerg overwhelmed Tarsonis and decimated the population. Having achieved his goals, Mengsk left the planet and abandoned Kerrigan to the aliens.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00013=Sickened by Mengsk's treachery, Raynor quit the Sons of Korhal. He raced to the planet's surface to save Kerrigan, but was too late: no trace of her remained.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00014=Having destroyed the Confederacy, Mengsk crowned himself emperor of the newly formed Terran Dominion; a government that would prove to be just as corrupt as its predecessor.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00015=Raynor mourned the loss of Kerrigan and vowed revenge. Unbeknownst to him, however, the zerg hadn't killed Kerrigan. Instead, they took her to the volcanic planet of Char.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00016=On Char, Kerrigan was transformed into the alien Queen of Blades. She became a being of immense psionic power, loyal to the Overmind, ruler of the zerg Swarm.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00017=Separate from Tassadar's forces, another protoss faction emerged from the shadows. Zeratul and his dark templar sought to end the zerg expansion through stealth and the power of the Void.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00018=The two protoss forces joined together against the Swarm, but the Overmind was able to discover their secret homeworld of Aiur. The zerg quickly invaded, and the Overmind embedded itself in the planet's surface.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00019=Zeratul taught Tassadar how to combine his powers with those of the Void.  Tassadar fused those energies into his ship, and crashed it into the gargantuan Overmind, destroying it utterly.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00020=Despite Tassadar's sacrifice, the protoss on Aiur were forced to seek refuge on the dark templar homeworld of Shakuras. With the Overmind destroyed, Kerrigan assumed control of the zerg.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00021=Raynor began a resistance movement against the oppressive Dominion. In retaliation, Mengsk deployed his greatest weapon -- propaganda -- to marginalize Raynor's efforts and paint him as a terrorist.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00022=It is now four years later. Kerrigan and the zerg have remained ominously silent. Meanwhile, the Dominion has grown in power and extended its influence throughout the Koprulu sector.
Conversation/InstallerText/Line00023=Raynor and his forces, plagued by low morale and lack of resources, continue their struggle against the Dominion. Victory against Mengsk, however, seems more distant than ever....
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00001=Hope that thing was worth all the effort. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00010=It really is fascinating, Commander. Preliminary analysis suggests that its energy signature radiates at ten times the magnitude of any previously recorded alien antiquities. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00011=Yeah, well -- don't start pickin' at it, Stetmann. With our luck, it'd probably just open up a black hole and swallow the ship....
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00012=Goodness, I hadn't factored the odds of that potentiality... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00013=Oh -- Commander, Commander, Commander. I've been giving these artifacts some thought...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00014=Oh -- don't worry -- I know what you're gonna say -- I haven't been running diagnostics on them or anything! Well, at least not directly, at any rate...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00015=Just spit it out, son.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00016=Well, sir -- when the second piece was added? The ambient containment field spiked drastically. Hm, I know. If we add any more pieces, we'll need to draw even more power from the ship's fusion core to maintain the field. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00017=So holding these things is dangerous and expensive. Well, the sooner we get 'em off my ship, the better.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00018=I'm pleased to see these things haven't blown up the ship... Yet.
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00019=Sir, given the visual similarity between the various pieces, have you considered that they might combine to create a larger, more distinct object? 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00020=With everything else going on, Stetmann, I couldn't care less what they do, just that we get paid when we finally hand 'em over to the Moebius boys. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00021=So these artifacts are the key to freeing Kerrigan...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00022=Pretty amazing coincidence, Tychus just showing up out of the blue... offering us the job to collect these damn things.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00023=Statistically, sir -- the probability of coincidence is miniscule. However, these artifacts do represent a power beyond our current scientific understanding... 
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00024=If anything could the give the Queen of Blades pause - perhaps these are it?
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00028=All this... ancient alien hocus-pocus is a little outta my pay scale. I just pray that when the time comes...
Conversation/LabFidgetsArtifact/Line00029=...these things bring her back to me.  
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00001=Ok. No more field trips! Next time take a robot! Or a camera! Or-or a sketchbook!
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00002=Ah! Yes! You have a question, sir?
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00003=We need more samples!
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00004=Oh, ah tread lightly, sir. The odds of us being swallowed by the Swarm are two point eight nine five to one. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00005=Sir, I-I've been analyzing your tactics and, oh ok, nevermind. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00006=I-I don't know! I don't know!
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00007=Still some clearing up to do in here...
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00008=Ummm...yes! I mean no! ...I mean ...
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00009=Eight-hundred-and-two-to-the-power-four-add-twelve, don't forget the decimal point... to the third exponent of...
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00010=Gah! Whoa! Commander! Hello, how long have you been standing there?
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00011=Ah, yeah ok. Have you seen my stapler? Little hint, it's red.
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00012=Well, I'm just glad my research has helped the war effort, Commander. 
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00013=Did you really have to shoot the place up so much?
Conversation/LabFidgetsCowin/Line00014=Sir, you should check out the Research Console. There's some exciting developments there!
Conversation/LabFidgetsZeratulCrystal/Line00001=Damn that thing was freaky.
Conversation/LabFidgetsZeratulCrystal/Line00002=Thanks, Zeratul, I guess...
Conversation/LabFidgetsZeratulCrystal/Line00003=Always wanted to see the end of the universe.
Conversation/LabFidgetsZeratulCrystal/Line00004=Soooo somehow Kerrigan is supposed to save us?
Conversation/LabFidgetsZeratulCrystal/Line00005=Weird. Weird. Weird.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00001=Jim, let me in. What really happened on Tarsonis? Whatever it was, I can see it tearing you up inside. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00002=Well it would definitely affect brain chemistry, so it could be used as some kind of a drug or stimulant I suppose.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00003=I've run a few tests on the terrazine gas like you asked. It's clearly related to vespene gas, but there are some very exotic organics added into the mix. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00005=I understand. If you ever change your mind - I'm here.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00006=Drugs, huh? That's just wonderful.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00007=That's right, but I wouldn't mess with it if I were you. It's a Khaydarin 'Ihan' crystal. It's a memory storage device - lets you experience what other people have seen or done. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00008=I see we have a new acquisition. Is it a protoss device?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00014='Lot of rumors goin' around. I'm guessin' you've heard plenty about me and Kerrigan by now...
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00015=Are the stories true? That Mengsk just... abandoned her to the zerg on Tarsonis? 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00016=That zerg woman seemed to know you. She really rattled you didn't she?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00017=Me and her... well, we go back a ways. She was a Ghost, once. Back then we were hooked up with Mengsk and fighting to get rid of the old Confederacy. (beat) We made a pretty good team.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00018=What happened to her?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00024=Her...plus a few billion innocent civilians. After that we knew exactly what kind of man we'd been dealing with. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00027=She was a casualty of war. No offense, Doc, but I really don't like to talk about it.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00031=(bitter) Tarsonis... that's where it all went down. Mengsk stole a psi-emitter from the Confederacy and planted it there. He knew that it'd attract the zerg and... 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00034=Just out of curiosity, I did some tests on the minerals from Redstone. I thought you should know - I found trace quantities of jorium, a rare crystal with very unique properties. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00035=I'm all ears, Doc. What kind of properties?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00036=Jorium resonates at the same frequency as certain brain waves. It's been theorized that it could be used to stimulate brain activity or even produce psionic abilities in human subjects.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00038=A sudden increase in psionic ability could induce a psychotic break, but Spectres aren't the monsters we were led to believe. Nova lied to us.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00039=What the hell does Tosh want that for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00040=Any guesses what it's used for?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00041=They can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doin'.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00042=I don't care about much of anything anymore, but the one thing I hold onto is seeing Mengsk brought to justice before I die.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00044=(sighs) Our revolution began that day - the day Mengsk murdered a whole planet and called it justice.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00047=Jim, I've been investigating the claims that Nova made about Spectres turning into psychotic killers. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00049=I can't believe it. That recording proves it's all true; Mengsk, Tarsonis, all of it... What will you do now?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00050=Tell the people. Every man, woman and child in the Dominion needs to know what their beloved Emperor is capable of.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00051=The backlash will be awful. There'll be riots and uprisings everywhere... But that's just what you want, isn't it?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00052=It's a start. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00055=Jim, I hear that we're working for the Dominion now. Is that true?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00056=We've got a chance to take on Kerrigan and maybe, just maybe, set things right. The devil himself could offer me that deal and I'd still take it. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00057=So what did you find out?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00058=[Sad 70]That's what worries me. [/Sad]Just don't lose sight of who you are - that's what's important. A lot of people are counting on you and... I'm one of 'em.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00061=[Surprise 70]Yet you don't fear it at all.[/Surprise] You're a fascinating man, Jim Raynor. You know more about the protoss and the zerg than any of the experts I've read about.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00071=My God. Billions of innocent people. That's...that's just...monstrous. No wonder you hate him so much.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00077=Honestly, there's no evidence that Spectres are any more prone to aberrant behavior than ordinary people. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00161=I'm ok, Doc, before you start asking. 
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00162=You were staring at that protoss device for a very long time.[Sad 70] Are you sure?[/Sad]
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00163=(spooked) Well, now you mention it I could use a drink or two. Maybe what I saw'd make more sense if I was drunk.
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00164=(concerned) What was it, Jim?
Conversation/LabHanson/Line00165=An old friend of mine...looking for the end of the world.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00054=Zerg evolve very rapidly, but if I could just examine some of their chrysalises, I know I can find a weakness.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00056=I've heard reports of hyper-rare mutant strains within the zerg gene pool. Studying some of those would be highly informative.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00058=We're really close to understanding zerg biology on a whole new level! I know it'll be tricky, but some samples from zerg queens would give me the last few genetic components I need.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00060=The protoss have some incredible technology! I can unlock some of their secrets if we can find enough protoss relics for me to study.
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00062=The protoss excel at energy manipulation. As I understand it, Arcthium gems are key to their technology. If we secure some of those I'm sure we can make a breakthrough. 
Conversation/Labconsole/Line00064=The memories in that Ihan crystal are ideal for learning about the Dark Templar's battle strategies. Once you've studied it, we'll be able correlate the lessons learned and apply them to our troops!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00001=Ah Sir, okay. We have made a major breakthrough. Really big! There's two ways we can apply it to our forces. But, uh, y'know, we can only afford one. You can use the research console to choose which way we should go.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00002=I've detailed a new research project on the console, over there. Please take a look if you have time. It's right over there.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00003=Whoa. Those hunter-killer hydralisks were just fascinating! I've developed a new pathogen that can be delivered via high velocity gauss rounds. This will make our marines' ammunition particularly effective against biological targets!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00004=Well I have completed the research on exo-dermal plating, thank you very much. I've suggested some adjustments to Swann that'll make our flame weapons much more effective against zerg flesh!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00005=Well, it's all very complicated, the important thing is, it's protoss thinking combined with my own! Good stuff!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00006=I took alot of that protoss technology and added my own improvements. They're good. I'm good. It's good!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00007=Well well well, ladies and gentlemen I've cracked it! The queens' dissection provided some real insight into the zerg's biology. On a practical level, I've advised Swann about fine tuning of our siege tank ammunition to cause maximum damage!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00008=You know all that protoss stuff you found? Yeah, I based some of my work on that. Have a look!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00009=Ah those protoss relics are amazing. I've figured out a way to generate resonant kinetic fields that'll reinforce our vehicles' armor. Huh? Yeah!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00010=So, the zerg. They've got some pretty crazy biological elements! I used that to come up with something -- I think you'll like it.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00011=Ha! I was right about those Arcthium gems! Even using tiny slivers of them to boost our reactors' output increases energy regeneration by twenty five percent!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00012=Yeah, I used some zerg biology to come up with some amazing stuff! Watch out, I'm just getting started!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00013=Huh. Ahh, well the Dark Templar have developed some highly unusual tactics. We can't mimic their kind of fluid combat style exactly but the improved coordination we've learned will net us an increase in firepower for all of our units.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00014=Zerg! Stetmann! Together, it equals great research. Look on the console!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00015=That's an excellect choice, sir!
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00016=I think that will really help.
Conversation/Labresearch/Line00017=Ha! Yes, I was hoping you'd pick that.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00003=Well look at that! The Heaven's Devils! Those were the good ol' days, weren't they Jimmy? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00004=No one likes a smart-ass, James. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00005=Some of the boys are long gone. But we're still alive and kickin' serious ass. Heh. Who'd a thunk it? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00034='Both too stubborn to know when to quit.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00037=The old Heaven's Devils. We were one of the deadliest units in the Marine Corps -- that is until all hell broke loose and we were forced to go AWOL. Now, every last one of us is either dead, in jail or on the run. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsArmyphoto/Line00040=If by 'good' you mean you gettin' us all into trouble and scattering us to the wind, then yeah, I'd say they were good. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsBadge/Line00005=Oh man, didn't the Magistrate here know he was hiring an arch-criminal as his Marshal? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsBadge/Line00006=He was countin' on it. Guess my 'tough guy' reputation kept things nice and quiet 'round here. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsBadge/Line00007=All the time I wore that badge, I never had to shoot anybody.  
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsBadge/Line00008=Well where's the fun in that?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00001=Or is that half empty?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00003=Feels like I'm always being watched...
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00004=Ol' Mengsk is gonna get what's comin' to him...all in good time. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00005=I should probably lay off this stuff...or up the intake. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00007=Damn, the glass is always half full!
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00017=What is this swill? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00019=Well, I ain't gonna toast myself...
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsDrinks/Line00022='Wonder if this stuff's flammable...?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00004=Now you're a big time rebel, I guess law and order don't mean much to ya' anymore? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00005=Real catchy headline. Hope you ain't gonna go gettin' a big head on me. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00006=Oh hell no! It's just that a man as pretty as me should have his own headlines! 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00007=That depends on who's definin' what they mean. Laws are meant to protect folks and keep the peace. Mengsk's only interest is power. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00008=And you're just the man to bring him down, huh? Well good luck with your holy crusade there, Jimmy. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsEvolutionofrevolution2/Line00034=You sound jealous, Tychus.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00001=Some propaganda. But one day 'emperor' Mengsk is gonna' pay for all the lives he's ground under his heel. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00002=I've been thinkin' about that a lot, lately. I don't know. Maybe after all the bad things we done...
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00003=Have to say, Jimmy - you turned into a real impressive fighter. If I was ol' Mengsk, I'd be runnin' scared from you, too. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00006=Never figured you for the revolutionary type, Jimmy. How the hell'd you get mixed up in all that nonsense anyway?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00007=...it was some kind of atonement? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00008=(scoffs) Huh.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00009=You really mean that, Tychus?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsFreedomposter/Line00010=Nah. I was just kiddin'.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHeavensDevils/Line00001=One of our old Death Cards. Did you stick this up here, Tychus?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHeavensDevils/Line00002=I surely did. Figured I'd leave somethin' for these fine folks to remember me by. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHeavensDevils/Line00073=You mean other than craters and smoking bodies? (scoffs) And you call me sentimental?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahead/Line00001=(grim) What was it like, Jimmy, fightin' them zerg?
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahead/Line00006=All the scrapes we were in back in the day, all the narrow escapes...
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahead/Line00007=...none of it compares to how terrible they are, Tychus. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahead/Line00008=You don't know what real fear is 'till you've got a thousand of these sons of bitches barreling down on ya'. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahunt/Line00001=What's this? I heard them zerg got burned out by them creepy protoss a few years back.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahunt/Line00002=Well, a trophy like that's gotta' fetch a good price on the black market. Up for some huntin', partner? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahunt/Line00003=Knock yourself out, Tychus. Me, I've hunted enough zerg for two lifetimes.  
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsHydrahunt/Line00038=It's been four years, and they're still finding burrowed dens out in the wastelands. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00001=Man, you still listenin' to this country-crap music after all these years? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00002=Word of advice, Tychus. Never get between a man and his juke box. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00003=I'm goin' to be glad to get off this planet so I don't have to hear this crap no more. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00004=That right? You should know that old juke box goes where I go. It'll be comin' with us.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00005=Never did know when to let go of things.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsJukebox/Line00012=Ohhh little jukebox... You're the only one that understands me.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsKerriganPhoto/Line00001=Sarah... sometimes I think it would have been better if you'd just died that day.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsLocalhero2/Line00001=You always did have a soft spot for the common folk. You gotta toughen up, Jimmy. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsLocalhero2/Line00006=The only thing this universe does with heroes is chew 'em up and spit 'em out.
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsLocalhero2/Line00007=Same old Tychus - always lookin' out for number one. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsLocalhero2/Line00008='Kept me alive this long, partner. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsvikingphoto2/Line00001=Guess they just needed a little push. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsvikingphoto2/Line00002=Everyone needs a hobby, Tychus. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsvikingphoto2/Line00003=This looks recent. This your doin', Jimmy? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsvikingphoto2/Line00004=You still take this whole revolution thing pretty serious, then. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetsvikingphoto2/Line00040=Folks in these parts are ready to fight back against Mengsk. 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetswantedposter/Line00006=Shaved head, Jimmy? I mean, weren't you ugly enough already? 
Conversation/MarSaraFidgetswantedposter/Line00007=Maybe, but I don't see you winnin' any beauty contests.
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00001=To access the mission briefing, manually access the console. 
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00002=If there's a problem, Commander, I'm here to help
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00003=Can I be of assistance, Commander? 
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00004=How are we doing today? 
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00005=Are we feeling well? 
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00006=Has your intake of alcoholic beverages affected your motor skills, sir? 
Conversation/MarSaraIdlesAdjutant/Line00007=Human input IS required for mission progression, sir. 
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00004=Don't you get uppity with me, boy. I heard all about you becoming a big time freedom fighter while I was away! What happened, Jimmy - the war for truth and justice get too much for ya?
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00005=So who's your mysterious buyer, Tychus? Who're we supposed to hand this artifact over to?
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00006=A bunch of eggheads I ran into called the Moebius Foundation.
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00007=Moebius? They're a legitimate research group. Why the hell are they talkin' to you?
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00008=Soon as yer boy Mengsk made it illegal to trade in alien goods, they got desperate. [Happy] And you know me, Jimmy - I am a great patron of the sciences.[/Happy]
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00009=Call me curious, but how'd you get out?
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00010=Well, I busted out of my cryo-freezer while they were transporting me to New Folsom. Oh, I musta' killed at least dozen guards with my bare hands...
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00011=Haha. Yeah, I've heard this one before! But you left out the part where you walked on water, made off with the Warden's daughter!
Conversation/MarSaraTychus/Line00012=I ain't licked yet, Tychus. And I promise you - Mengsk is goin' down one way or another. 
Conversation/MarSarafidgetsintro/Line00001=Welcome to StarCraft II storymode.

Clickable objects are highlighted by a glow, any people you see can be clicked on to talk to them.
Conversation/MarSaraidlesTychus/Line00001=So, nice place ya got here
Conversation/MarSaraidlesTychus/Line00002=Ugh, I hate this planet. 
Conversation/MarSaraidlesTychus/Line00003=Man, you ain't aged well at all. What happened to you? 
Conversation/MarSaraidlesTychus/Line00004=This is boring the hell out of me. I may as well have stayed in the freezer. 
Conversation/MarSaraidlesTychus/Line00005=Much more of this, I'm going to have to start entertaining myself... and you know what that means. 
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00001=Hey Raynor! I've got some fresh merc contracts for you if you 're interested. Come take a look.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00002=The Devil Dogs are looking for work again. If you need firebats - these are the best.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00003=Kel-Morian mercenaries always have attitude. I reckon a guy like you can keep 'em in line.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00004=Lot of people are lookin' to hire these guys right now. 
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00005=I pulled some strings with my old outfit to get this offer. Don't embarass me.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00006=These guys are new. Seems they didn't appreciate Mengsk abandoning the fringe worlds like that so they went independent.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00007=They got a high opinion of themselves, but these guys sure know their siege tanks.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00008=Damn pirates. War's cut down on commercial traffic so now they gotta work for a living.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00009=The Revenge got a new captain and they're looking for a patron. They're a good crew, kinda paranoid though.
Conversation/Merccontracts/Line00010=You remember Mira Han from Deadman's Port, right?

Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00001=(crackling)...any ship receiving this transmission...the zerg are invading Agria... 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00002=I hear the mighty Jim Raynor's on the move, but short on funds. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00003=Jim, refugee populations from across the Sector have been using Meinhoff as a staging point.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00004=There's a rare gas on Bel'Shir the protoss call 'the Breath of Creation'. They think it be a gift from their gods. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00005=The Moebius boys think there's another artifact on a world called Monlyth. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00006=We've received reports of a new Dominion salvage operation on Tarsonis. They're running a large number of supply trains with minimal security. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00007=We still need to access the adjutant we retrieved from Tarsonis. Our old mercenary associate Colonel Orlan is an expert in Confederate code decryption.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00008=The decrypted Adjutant contains records proving Mengsk ordered the massacre on Tarsonis, now we just need to broadcast those records. Mira Han gave us a tip that might help.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00009=We have the Odin, now we can use it to spearhead our take-over of the UNN studios on Korhal. Once the Odin has taken out their defenses, we'll broadcast our evidence against Mengsk. Figure they'll throw everything they have at us. They'll be talking about this one for years.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00010=We've received classified intel about a top secret Dominion lab on Castanar. A small team should be able infiltrate the lab and uncover exactly what kind of research the Dominion is doing there.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00011=Moebius wants us to go after another artifact on some dead world called Xil. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00012=Seems yer Queen of Blades figured out who's been payin us to snatch up all them artifacts. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00013=We've secured our landing zone thanks to you, Commander. General Warfield believes an attack on the primary hive is suicide under current conditions. A diversionary attack to cripple part of the zerg defenses will give us the opportunity we need.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00014=New Folsom is ripe for the taking, man. Every voice that was ever raised against Mengsk is penned up inside those walls. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00015=Everything is in motion to begin the final act - the invasion of the primary zerg hive on Char!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00016=...The Dominion abandoned us here ...We're just a small farming colony.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00017=We've got to evacuate before we're overrun....If you can hear this message, please help us!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00018=But with so many people in close proximity, an epidemic of some kind has started sweeping through the camps. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00019=Dominion troops are seizing control of Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00020=They have stockpiled vast amounts of guns and resources at the Backwater Station.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00021=It seems my faith in your abilities has been vindicated, Commander Raynor. Now the final blow must be struck. Use the artifact to neutralize the Queen of Blades and bring this bloodshed to an end.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00022=Raynor... the hounds of the void are closing in... I impart my memory - my very essence - into this Ihan crystal... so that you will see what I have seen... and that the future... may yet have hope.  
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00023=The planet Redstone's got the most valuable minerals around - an' with the zerg invasion, the Kel-Morians packed up and left it all behind. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00024=Some enterprisin' men could turn a big profit there. Meet me at Redstone if you want a piece of the action.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00025=(laughs) We call it terrazine and it be worth a fortune to the right bidder. Of course those protoss'll kill us if they catch us on their holy ground - or at least they'll try.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00026=Seizing that stockpile would deal a serious blow the the Dominion effort on Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00027=I returned to our ruined homeworld of Aiur. The zerg infestation still covered much of our beloved world... The desiccated remains of the Overmind were still there - a grim reminder of battles lost... and battles won.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00028=We let all them prisoners loose an' he'll never know what hit him. Just let me know when you're ready to pull the trigger.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00029=Supposedly there's protoss guarding it - a group of fanatics, call themselves the Tal'darim.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00030=Now don't get all sentimental thinking these Tal'darim are your old protoss buddies... 'cause they ain't.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00031=Apparently they sent in a specialist team - but they lost contact with 'em two days ago. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00032=Their bad luck, I guess. Figure we'll get hazard pay for this one... 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00033=Moebius' head- honcho, Dr. Narud, claims the zerg are attacking his main Research Campus on Tyrador. He can't evacuate his people until all their artifact research is safe.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00034=Thanks to your actions Mar Sara is now in a state of open revolt against Arcturus Mengsk. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00035=If we intercept the trains and liberate their contents before they can be shipped off-world, we could make a serious profit. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00036=I gathered allies and we made our way to the forbidden archive world of Zhakul. There, a triumvirate of mystic Preservers awaited us. And in the shadows... something else was watching - and waiting.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00037=If our intel's right, he should still be based at the merc-haven at Deadman's Port. He's not very trustworthy, but he's our best bet of breaking that encryption. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00038=Now, friend Raynor, you must see the Overmind's vision of the future. The end of my people... and of all things. This is our fate, should Kerrigan die...
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00039=Moebius've got themselves set-up again since the zerg chased 'em outta their old place. They say they've worked out where to find another artifact, lovely little place called Typhon. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00040=Commander, our mutual friends at the Moebius Foundation have located the last artifact fragment. When this final piece is secured we can proceed to Char and confront Kerrigan. Good luck, Mr. Raynor, I fear you'll need it.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00041=My people established a new colony on Haven. It was going well, but now the colony's gone dark. They're not responding on any frequency. We need to get there and see what the situation is. They might have been exposed to the zerg virus, and they are on the verge of protoss space. Jim, I'm worried that something has gone very wrong.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00042=The dominion is unveiling a new war machine called the 'Odin' on Korhal. If we hijack the Odin we can use it to gain access to the UNN studios and broadcast the records of Mengsk's war crimes.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00043=The Odin is currently in the testing facility on Valhalla.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00044=Once we begin, there will be no turning back.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00045=I shall rendezvous with you as soon as I receive your signal. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00046=Ensure that you are fully prepared, Commander. Destiny awaits!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00047=Please - my people need help! We've got to do something before it's too late!
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00048=Ex-convict Tychus Findlay has revealed the Dominion came to Mar Sara to excavate an alien artifact. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00049=Seizing the artifact will strike another blow against the Dominion and generate funds from selling it to Findlay's mysterious contacts.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00050=With the artifact secure you need to wait for transport at Backwater Station before you can leave Mar Sara. Transportation is on the way. 
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00051=Caution is advised - Dominion security forces may succeed in tracking the artifact to the station.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00052=The classified documents we found on Korhal imply the Dominion has a top secret bio-weapons lab on an orbital platform at Castanar. If the Dominion is cooking up a big surprise for us, I'd like to know about it.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00053=Backwater Station is the center of Dominion logistics on Mar Sara.
Conversation/Missionpitches/Line00054=Destroying Dominion authority here will cripple Emperor Mengsk's operations throughout the planet.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00001=The Zerg swarm came as was foretold.... and the Protoss, first born of the gods  -- rose to fight them. (beat) Now, the Xel'Naga that forged us all... are returning.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00002=But do they come to save...?
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00003=...or to destroy? 
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00004=(laughs) I knew you'd find your way here eventually.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00005=Your very presence defiles this place, Kerrigan.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00006=Do you hear them, Zeratul -- whispering from the stars? The galaxy will burn with their coming.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00007=Perhaps...
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00008=...but you won't live to see it!
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00009=Please. Our petty conflicts mean nothing now. A storm is coming that CANNOT be stopped. Fitting - that we should face oblivion together.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00010=Never! 
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00011=FATE cannot be changed. The END comes. And when it finds me... I shall embrace it at last.
Conversation/OldRivals/Line00012=The prophecy is uncertain. There is always hope.
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00001=This is Kerrigan. We've neutralized the Protoss, but there's a wave of Zerg advancing on this position We need immediate evac
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00002=Belay that order.  We're moving out. 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00003=What? You're not just gonna leave them? 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00004=(ignoring them all) All ships prepare to move away from Tarsonis on my mark.
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00005=Uh, boys? How about that evac? 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00006=Damn you, Arcturus! Don't do this. 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00007=It's done.  (beat)  Helmsman, signal the fleet and take us out of orbit.  Now! 
Conversation/RaynorsDream/Line00008=Commander? Jim? What the hell's going on up there-- 
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00001=Sir? You seem to have found something very interesting there. If you can bring me a sample in the lab, that would be great!
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00002=If you can bring me some samples in the lab, I bet I could learn alot about the zerg!  Sir.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00003=Y'know, if you can get me a sample of that, I could probably do something with it. Scientifically, I mean.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00004=If you get some of that to me in the lab, I can learn alot about the protoss. Maybe something that would help us.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00005=I have no idea what that is! Can you bring me a sample in the lab? Maybe something good will come of it!
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00006=Yay! I mean, uh, that's great commander. That's great!
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00007=I can't wait to dig into that. Scientifically, I mean. I'm not going to eat it.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00008=Definitely bring that by the lab when you're done!
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00009=When a science objective is met, check the Research Console in the lab for possible upgrades.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00010=Achieving science objectives can open new upgrades. Check the Research Console to see these upgrades.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00011=Commander, there is a research objective on this world. While not necessary, it would be advisable to seek it out.
Conversation/ScienceObjectiveCallouts/Line00012=You have located a research objective. Move your units close to acquire it.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00001=Yup. You can add upgrades for their tech right here on the console. But buildin' an army on the run ain't cheap. You brought back credits this time, right?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00003=Hey everybody! Our glorious leader has returned! Hey man, what's up, cowboy?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00004=What do ya got for me, Swann?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00005=The usual -- buildin' up our standin' forces.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00006=Look, I know money's been tight - but that artifact we just picked up from Mar Sara's gonna solve everything! 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00007=I've heard that before, brother. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00008=It's different this time.  
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00009=Yeah, I heard that one, too.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesArmory/Line00010=Bringin' my troops and hardware up to speed, huh?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00001=Ariel. If there was a cure you woulda found it by now! The only thing we can do is put an end to this once and for all.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00002=Where's Tosh? I thought he'd be here by now.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00003=He already left the ship. I thought you --
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00004=I won't accept that! Every one of my people can be saved. I'm close to finding the cure, I know it!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00005=Get Tosh on comms. I'm sure he's listenin' in anyway, encrypted or not.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00006=The choice is yours, James Raynor. We await your answer.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00007=Matt, open a channel to the protoss. Let's see how diplomatic they're feelin'.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00008=En Taro Tassadar, James Raynor. I am Executor Selendis. Your bravery and service to Aiur are known to us.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00009=En Taro Tassadar, Selendis. Listen - with all due respect, your fleet needs to pull back. The people on Haven are no threat to you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00010=Our Observers detected zerg hive spores infesting the colonists. They must be purified. If you wish to undertake this mission in our stead, we will permit it.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00011=Jim, some of my people are infested but you can't let the protoss just destroy them all! If you keep the protoss at bay, I know I can find a cure for the infestation.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00012=I ain't gonna stand by while you wipe out a whole colony, Selendis. Not while there's still a chance we can save 'em.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00013=Thank you Jim! Thank you so much. Whatever's happening on Haven, my people don't deserve to be wiped out. We'll make this right. I'll find a cure.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00014=I'm so sorry Ariel...but the Executor's right. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00015=Honor to you, James Raynor. You were ever a true friend of the protoss. Although this work is painful for you - many more lives will be saved by your actions this day.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00017=Patch it through.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00018=Well, well - the infamous Jim Raynor. My name is Nova. We should talk.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00019=Now what would one of Mengsk's pet Ghosts have to say to me?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00020=Tosh is lying to you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00021=We Spectres be the future! You just couldn't handle it, little girl.  
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00022=It don't matter how much you hate Mengsk, Tosh. If you and your Spectres are as bloodthirsty as it sounds, you're as much of a threat as he ever was. I'll be seeing you real soon.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00023=You should have told me what you were really planning, Tosh. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00024=Uploading tactical data now.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00025=I knew I could count on you, brother. Now let's go and bust open New Folsom!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00026=Then it shall be an honor to meet you on the field of battle. Your reputation as a commander is most impressive. I trust you will live up to it.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00027=What?! This isn't right! I thought you were a better man than this, Jim!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00028=You've made a poor choice, Mr. Raynor. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00030=Join me there and we can shut it down for good.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00032=But I'll take your word over a Dominion assassin's any day.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00033=Every Ghost that became a Spectre has gone on a psychotic killing spree. The ones I've captured are held in New Folsom. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00034=Tosh wants to reactivate his Spectre buddies using the substances you helped him collect.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00035=We've come this far together - may as well see it through.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00037=Tosh's Spectre facilities are on Avernus Station.  
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00038=The only cure for zerg infestation is purification by fire. You know this to be true, James Raynor.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00039=This be the moment of truth. Make your choice. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00040=Alright, Nova - what's your plan?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00041=If you choose to resist us, we will meet in glorious combat.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00042=I can cure them, Jim - believe me!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00043=Sir, we have an incoming transmission. It's highly encrypted.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00044=Don't listen to her brother. Help me bust the Spectres from New Folsom, and we'll bring down Mengsk together!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00045=New Folsom is full of psychopathic killers. Do you really want to release them into the galaxy?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00046=I be helping you against Mengsk, and my people will too. She won't even join you.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00047=He's a psychotic time bomb. He'll be on your side right up until he puts a knife in your back.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00048=You'll regret this, brother.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00049=We're almost to Haven, but there's still been no contact from -- 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00050=Jim! You have to stop this!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00051=Sir, there's a protoss fleet holding in orbit!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00052=They're disrupting all communications to the surface - and it looks like they're powering up their main weapons!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00053=Believe me, they wouldn't have come all the way here if their data wasn't conclusive.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesBridge/Line00054=Call off your fleet Selendis, this is a terran thing. I'll handle it myself.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00001=Y'know, I've been thinkin'... 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00002='Scares me more than the zerg...
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00003=(unphased) We're gonna have to take out those Nydus worms before we can make a move on the main hive. Them zerg burstin' up under us wherever they please ain't exactly conducive to our health and well-being.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00004=Well, placing charges at the right spots in their Nydus network could flood the whole system with lava. What's your take, General? 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00005=It's dangerous, but it could work. Bigger problem's still their fliers. Even if we could move our units forward, we can't provide adequate air cover while the skies are contested.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00006=Any suggestions?
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00007=Intel shows eighty percent of the zerg fliers nest on an infested platform hanging in low orbit. We take that down, we'll own the air.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00008=Hell, if this platform's so important, why not just nuke it? 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00009=The nests are burrowed deep into the superstructure. Surface detonations won't do it. We'd need to land a strikeforce on the platform and take it apart piece by piece. It's your call, Raynor. 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00010='Long as the zerg can use the Nydus network, our whole force is under threat. I feel for our fly boys - but shuttin' down those tunnels has to be our top priority.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00011=That's not my assessment, but I will defer. You're the expert here... Good hunting, Commander!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00012=Good call, Jimmy. Let's give the zerg a lesson in how we do things Heaven's Devils style!
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00013=We can deal with the Nydus worms when they surface, but there ain't no way we can advance without air support. We gotta' take that platform down.
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00014=We came all the way down here just to head back into space? 
Conversation/ScriptedScenesChar/Line00015=I only wish I could go with you. Give 'em hell, Raynor!
Conversation/ScriptedscenesCantina/Line00001=Guess you heard the news by now, Raynor. Looks like you're back in business. 
Conversation/ScriptedscenesCantina/Line00002=That I am, Mr. Hill. An' fightin' the zerg and Dominion all at once is gonna take its toll on my standing forces. You got any guns for hire?
Conversation/ScriptedscenesCantina/Line00003=Well y'know, the invasion makes it a sellers' market right now. Still, your bartender over there makes a hell of a Mai Tai... So sure - I've got some mercenary contracts you might be interested in.
Conversation/ScriptedscenesCantina/Line00004=You're all heart, Mr. Hill.
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00001=Commander! The alien artifact is all secure in the lab, Sir! You know seeing it got me to thinking about my special projects...
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00002=Whoa - slow down, Stetmann. What do you mean 'projects'? You doing some kinda research down here?
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00003=Yeah, well, not yet, sir. I still need some additional specimens to get things going. [Happy 50]Once I get those, we can make some big improvements to our weapon systems and tactics![/Happy]
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00004=Well, I'm all for that. What do you need?
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00005=All kinds of things! I've entered the details into our database. If you run into something on a mission that we need, you'll be notified automatically.
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00006=Just try not to blow up the ship, okay Stetmann? 
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00007=I've heard of these Ihan crystals before...
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00008=Supposedly, they allow ya' to relive another person's memories. (beat) Whatever Zeratul's uncovered...
Conversation/Scriptedsceneslab/Line00009=...he was desperate for me to see it too. Well, here goes nothin'...
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00001=Yeah yeah, good old days, robbin' trains, yadda yadda, bang bang. (Excited) I'm making Diamondbacks!
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00002=Just keep those colonists out of my armory. That's a disaster just waitin' to happen...
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00003=Now we got pirates on the ship. Kachinsky -- better take an inventory.
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00004=My shift is almost over. Little drinkin', little shut-eye.  Some more drinkin'. Then right back to work.
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00005=So, we're pirates ourselves these days. Hey Kachinsky! Got any rum? Aargh.
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00006=I don't like them artifacts. Machinery I understand. Weapons, no problem. Those artifacts... they're like magic or somethin'.
Conversation/SwannPissedLines/Line00007=Gotta hand it to you, chief. Stealin' an artifact out from under the zerg and the protoss. You sure go big.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00001=Thank goodness you're here. I'll give you control of the main buildings so you can help us evacuate the colony.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00002=Sir? I've detected large numbers of Mutalisks closing in on you. They'll be in position to attack any moment now.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00003=We better step it up and save these folks before it starts raining glave wurms.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00004=Commander, another convoy will be heading out soon.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00005=Everyone's here, let's go!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00006=We'll need to escort the convoys all the way to the main starport for them to have a chance of escaping this planet.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00007=Is the road safe up ahead? Guess we'll find out.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00008=Someone had the right idea building bunkers to defend the roads...but why are they empty?
Conversation/THanson01/Line00009=The Dominion military abandoned them when the zerg attacked, they didn't give a damn about the colony.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00010=Sorry to hear that, Doc. At least these bunkers are in a good spot, I'll see if we can't get them manned.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00011=It's a long haul to the starport, partner. How can we be expected to guard the whole thing?
Conversation/THanson01/Line00012=Those are innocent people! What are you doing!?
Conversation/THanson01/Line00013=Hey, that's a zerg chrysalis. Stetmann wanted samples of 'em to research. Let's get an SCV over there to harvest it.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00014=Commander, our colony is already being destroyed without you helping it along!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00016=Let's get the hell out of here!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00017=A whole world lost...my people slaughtered... What did we do to deserve this?
Conversation/THanson01/Line00018=Don't stop for anything! Let's roll!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00019=That's the last of them! Go! Lift off now!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00023=So many dead... If only we'd gotten away sooner. Perhaps there's enough of us left to start over... if we can find somewhere safe...
Conversation/THanson01/Line00024=Commander, do something! My people are dying out there!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00025=We've lost the colony, but my people got out alive thanks to you, Commander.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00026=Go! Go! The zerg could get here any minute!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00027=Don't leave without us!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00028=Get to the starport! Move it!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00029=We have another convoy ready to be escorted, Commander.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00030=I reckon we can use a mobile force to keep it clear or build more bunkers to block the approaches - either way should work.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00031=Sweet God... the slaughter... I can't bear to look.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00032=People I've known since I was a little girl...all gone. (sobs)
Conversation/THanson01/Line00033=The zerg are terrible... but it was the Dominion that murdered this colony by leaving us here to die.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00034=We're almost done, Commander. Another convoy will be starting out soon.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00035=The next convoy will be on its way shortly.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00036=Just a few stragglers left to bring in, their convoy's heading to the starport any minute now.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00037=Sir, we just detected zerg organisms entering the upper atmosphere. I can't give you an exact fix but they're heading your way.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00038=Sir, I'm picking up seismic disturbances closing in on your position. I think it's some kind of tunneling zerg.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00039=Wonderful, it's just like them to keep things nice and interestin'.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00040=The convoy's in danger. Hit 'em boys!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00041=The colonists are hurtin'! We gotta save 'em!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00042=Zerg are attacking the convoy! Let's rock!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00043=The zerg have gotten through! Take 'em down!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00044=You're killing more of my people! You monster!
Conversation/THanson01/Line00046=I got us some firebats, cowboy. These suckers've got flamethrowers that'll roast the zerg but good! 
Conversation/THanson01/Line00071=The first convoy from Larks' Crossing will be moving out soon.
Conversation/THanson01/Line00082=The next convoy is almost ready to go, Commander. Please alert your men.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00001=Thank you so much for responding to our distress call, Commander. I'm Dr. Ariel Hanson and I represent the people of the Agria colony.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00002=Pleasure to meet ya', Doc. You can call me Jim. What's the situation?
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00003=I pray you're right, Commander. The zerg are more terrible than I ever imagined.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00004=Don't worry, Doc. We'll get your folks through to that starport safe and sound.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00005=We don't have room on the transports for all my people, but we need to pack the remaining ships with as many as we can.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00010=The zerg have overwhelmed our planetary defenses. The colony is lost.
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00011=For the past twelve hours we've been evacuating people to the nearest starport. But the zerg attacks have become so intense, we can't get any more through. 
Conversation/THanson01Briefing/Line00012=If you can guard the highway, we can start sending the remaining groups every few minutes. 
Conversation/THanson02/Line00001=Hey hotshot! I got schematics to build them Hellions you saw on Mar Sara, should be good down there!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00002=Ain't gonna be so easy, darlin'. This whole sector's crawling with zerg.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00003=Whoa! That sure pissed 'em off. Maybe we should wait for daylight?
Conversation/THanson02/Line00004=Seriously, you sure like stirrin' up the hornet's nest!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00005=Please.... kill me!!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00006=Infested marines!? Oh hell Jimmy, I don't care for that notion one bit.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00007=Sir, if you kill one of those creatures, Stetmann can study it and perhaps learn something.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00008=Is that...some sort of nest? You'd better destroy it!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00009=Alright, this sector is clear! Nice work boys, now move on to the next area!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00010=Alright, boys - we can't risk the contagion spreading to this camp! I want a perimeter set and some bunkers in place now!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00011=Sun's comin' up! We gotta hold on a little longer!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00012=Looks like that sector is clear, Jim. Better move on to the next one.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00013=Good job, guys. This area's secure!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00014=I'm not detecting any more infested structures in that sector, Jim.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00015=There's got to be somewhere out there the aliens haven't touched... some undiscovered paradise waiting just for us.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00016=Looks like this area is secure. Keep it up, fellas! We can stop this!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00018=Y'know, I think I saw this in a movie once...
Conversation/THanson02/Line00019=Scans are picking up a unique zerg bio-signature. It appears to be a burrowing creature that is underground during the day and emerges only at night.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00020=You going sweet on that doctor lady, Jimmy? Can't see why else we'd keep fighting for these damn dirt farmers.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00021=Keep your eyes peeled. There's gonna be more of them out there.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00022=Rise and shine, boys! Now it's our time to do some damage!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00023=Those creeps are gonna be coming outta the woodwork any minute now. We better get back to the base.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00024=Gonna get us some payback! Let's waste some freaks!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00025=You should set some guards. They'll be coming again soon.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00026=Now we gotta hold out 'till sunrise. Brace yourselves, this could get ugly.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00028=Finally we can get out there and hit back.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00029=Alright, let's move out and take it to 'em! We've got to clear this area!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00030=Daybreak in thirty seconds.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00031=Nightfall in thirty seconds.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00032=Let's burn this place before they come creepin' again!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00033=They've broken through the south barricade! Get some troops down there, now!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00034=What is that...thing!? Was it human?
Conversation/THanson02/Line00035=You're almost done! There's just a handful of infested bio-signs left. I'll highlight their locations on your map.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00036=Oh hell yes. This is gonna be OUR time alright.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00037=Ok, let's find some infested areas to clear.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00038=Don't forget you have to be back by dark!
Conversation/THanson02/Line00039=Reckon we musta killed thousands of 'em last night. Can't be many left, right?
Conversation/THanson02/Line00041=You've dealt a serious blow to their numbers, Jim, you're doing great.
Conversation/THanson02/Line00067=You did it, Jim! I knew you wouldn't let us down! Now I've got to get my people somewhere safe.
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00001=(horrified) Oh no! Those...things are infested refugees? This is a nightmare!
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00002=So what are we lookin' at, Doc?
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00003=Yeah, this ain't good at all.
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00004=Then we'll hit the infested buildings by day and protect our base at night. 
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00005=It looks like they burrow underground by day and emerge only at night.  The virus must make them vulnerable to the high UV output of Meinhoff's star.
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00006=It's a zerg virus. All we can do is burn it out. 
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00007=Every one of those infested buildings has to be destroyed. 
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00008=where are all the people?
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00009=Don't worry, Doc - we'll contain this thing.
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00010=Our readings indicate some kind of bio-infestation is spreading through the refugee camps. Even the buildings are being covered by it!
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00011=I've seen this kinda thing before. 
Conversation/THanson02Briefing/Line00012=But... 
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00001=Sir! The Purifier's on the move!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00002=The protoss are retreating! You've done it!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00003=Sir! I'm detecting a massive energy spike! The Purifier is about to fire!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00004=I'm sorry it came to this, Selendis - but these folks have been through enough already. You need to leave 'em be.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00005=Hell! They're ready to fire their planet cracker. We've got to stop that Purifier!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00006=The Purifier is charged up and firing! We're running out of time!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00007=Commander, a protoss squadron is going after the colony ships. Those people don't stand a chance unless we stop it!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00008=Energy output is peaking. The Protoss are going to destroy the second colony base!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00009=They'll fire on the settlement any second now. Get clear!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00010=The protoss have arrived at another settlement, sir.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00011=The Purifier's coming into range of a colony base!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00012=They're heading to the last base! This is it boys. End of the line!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00013=That's one Nexus down, keep at it boys! We've got to stop that ship!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00014=Another Nexus gone, great work! Don't give 'em a chance to regroup!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00015=The Purifier's shields are offline sir! Hit it now!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00016=Sir! The Purifier has arrived and is on the move!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00017=Some of the colonists didn't make it to our base in time. We should be ready to assist them when the protoss attack.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00018=The colonists left some resources behind after they evacuated. We should pick them up.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00019=The colonists have evacuated the first settlement in the Purifier's path.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00020=Whoa! The Purifier has sent our units into a dimensional warp field! The effect should only be temporary though.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00021=You have won the day as a warrior and I salute you, James Raynor. We shall meet again, perhaps as allies, perhaps as enemies. As the gods will.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00022=Help! They're destroying our ship!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00023=They've almost reached the next base, hurry!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00024=Estimate protoss arrival at the next colony base within twenty seconds, sir.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00025=The colonists have successfully evacuated that settlement!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00026=Excellent work! The colonists in that settlement have been evacuated!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00027=Great job! The last settlement is clear! All colonists are safe and accounted for!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00028=They're going to destroy our ship! We're all going to die!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00029=Our ship's going to burn up. The protoss are killin' us!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00030=Thank you! Those protoss almost got us!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00031=Thanks Raynor's Raiders! We're gettin' out of here!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00032=I've located the protoss Nexuses that are channeling power to the Purifier's shields. We'll have to destroy them before we can stop the Purifier!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00033=Warning. Protoss squadron detected approaching colonist settlement.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00034=Warning. Protoss squadron detected approaching the final colonist settlement.
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00035=That was a close one! Thanks!
Conversation/THanson03A/Line00067=You are as cunning as the stories say, James Raynor. I hope your belief in these colonists will be vindicated. 
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00001=Jim, the protoss are already closing in on the colony! My people don't stand a chance!
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00002=We're gonna have to stop that 'Purifier' of theirs before it can wipe the whole place out. Get everyone evacuated to the main base, Ariel.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00003=I got something that'll help ya. I called in some favors and got us Viking schematics.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00004=Well, 'least we can we can count on 'em bein' methodical. They'll stop to burn every settlement along the way.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00005=Jim... The Purifier's drawing power from several protoss Nexus -- its shields are completely impenetrable!
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00006=Easy: we knock out those Nexii first, then we take down the Purifier.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00007=You sure know how to pick a fight, Cowboy. 
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00008=Remember, they can change from a jet into a combat walker and back again. Pretty nifty stuff.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00009=If the Purifier gets that far - we're done.
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00010=How can you stop something like that?
Conversation/THanson03ABriefing/Line00011=Don't worry Ariel, we'll stop 'em!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00001=What the hell are those things?
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00002=Sir, it's done. I'm not detecting any more zerg, but we have a problem in the lab.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00003=Sir! Another settlement is being infested by the zerg!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00004=Ariel?
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00005=Sir, Stetmann says Dr. Hanson has locked herself in the lab. Alone. She's desperate to save her people, I'm worried about what she might do.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00006=I want some SCVs repairing those Vikings right now! I need 'em out there raising hell!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00007=The last settlement is under threat, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00008=All of the colony settlements have now been overrun, sir. They're all infested.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00009=The zerg have fully infested a settlement, sir, but we still need to destroy the structure there to stop it spreading further.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00010=Sir, the infested are closing in on a settlement to the north. 
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00011=The infestation's overwhelmed another settlement, there's no stopping this thing!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00012=Damn, they're relentless! They've got another settlement!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00013=Warning. Class five bio-signature detected converging on the command center.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00014=I'm sorry, sir, but we've lost a second settlement to the zerg!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00015=That was too close, thanks!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00016=She was insisting her vaccine would work and she was going to prove it. I haven't been able to contact her since. 
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00017=Stay sharp! I want anyone that leaves the ship wearing a suit. Last thing I need is more people getting infested.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00018=Infestation source detected.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00019=Sir, that Virophage structure is spreading the zerg virus to the colonists!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00020=The infested are heading to a settlement in the south!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00021=Another settlement is coming under attack!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00022=Oh man, I hope she didn't do anything stupid. Keep everyone out of there, Matt, I'll deal with this.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00023=I knew Raynor'd save us!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00024=Eggs...those structures must be acting as giant incubators for the infested.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00025=There's no sign of the infestation left at that settlement, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00026=That settlement has been cleared of zerg bio-signatures. Well done, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00027=Good job, sir. I'm picking up two more concentrations of zerg bio-signatures.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00028=Sir, I'm detecting some large zerg flyers. They match the reported profiles for brood lords; be careful, they're lethal against ground targets.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00029=Then we'll hit 'em from the air! Where are my Vikings at?
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00030=They infest marines too, brother.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00031=Zerg infestation level reduced to thirty three percent. 
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00032=That's another one down, sir! No time to rest, though. There's still  more zerg clusters that need cleaning out .
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00033=There are no more zerg left in that settlement.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00034=Scanners indicate that settlement is now clean, sir.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00035=You've destroyed the last of the zerg at that settlement.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00038=My orders still stand - shouldn't be a problem for you though, Tychus.
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00040=Can't take much more of this!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00041=We'd all be dead without you!
Conversation/THanson03B/Line00042=We've got to destroy all the virophages. The more of them there are the more infested we'll have to fight.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00002=We've all laid it on the line for these folks more than once.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00003=I know it's terrible, but if we wipe out these infested settlements, we'll save the whole damn planet from bein' overrun.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00004=Ain't nothin' a little fire won't cure. Lotta ground to cover though. We ain't got enough troops to be everywhere at once.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00006=Don't worry about it. Swann's already got that covered.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00007=Yeah I got ya' covered. Had to call in a few favors to get the schematics for these babies. You owe me big time, Cowboy.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00008=Those Vikings'll make all the difference. But it looks like some of the infested colonists are turning already.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00009=Don't forget these bad boys can switch between air and ground mode any time you need 'em to.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00010=But there's only one way we can help them now. We've gotta save the ones we can - and kill the rest.
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00011=Let's just get this done. 
Conversation/THanson03BBriefing/Line00013=And those structures are infesting more of 'em.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00001=Sir, it turns out there are a few Confederate vehicles in the hills the Dominion haven't salvaged yet...
Conversation/THorner01/Line00002=Diamondbacks! Man, I didn't think they made it past prototyping! Their rail guns'll be great for stopping those trains...no pun intended.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00003=There may be other vehicles around that we can commandeer. We should keep our eyes open.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00004=Adjutant 23-46... online... system recording... N-N-New Gettysberg Defense Initiative... S-S-Submit a-access codes.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00005=I'll upload their schematics to our Factory network.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00006=Check it out Jimmy, Dominion's started sending escorts to protect the trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00007=The Dominion're boosting their trains' speed somehow! You'll need to use Diamondbacks to catch them.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00008=Excellent work, sir. We can utilize the train's scrap payload to build more units.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00009=A train is coming through the western tunnel.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00010=Now let's see what they were so fired up to get their hands on...
Conversation/THorner01/Line00011=Commander, I'm picking up increased comm-traffic from the Dominion. Sounds like they're planning to attack our base. We better be ready.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00012=Sir, we're detecting electrical activity in the wreckage.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00013=Looks like the Dominion ran outta whatever they were juicing the trains with. They're putting out bigger escorts though, we better watch ourselves.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00014=Sir, the Dominion processing center is heavily guarded. We should just focus on taking out those trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00015=Damn, I ain't robbed a train in years! We should do this more often!
Conversation/THorner01/Line00016=Well I'll be. It's an old Confederate adjutant. Now what intel's so important they'd go and dig her up to recover it?
Conversation/THorner01/Line00017=A train is approaching through a tunnel in the northwest. 
Conversation/THorner01/Line00018=A train is exiting the southern tunnel.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00019=Sir, I'm detecting Dominion kill teams patrolling the tracks with large groups of Marauders. 
Conversation/THorner01/Line00020=I'll mark their location with a red warning symbol. Still, you should try to avoid them.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00021=We obviously won't find many natural mineral fields here, so we should make the most of what we can salvage from the trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00022=The Dominion are constructing a series of bunkers to protect the tracks. Be careful.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00023=Sir, one of the trains got through. We can't let too many get past us or we'll miss the cargo we're looking for.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00024=A second train got through, sir! We can't afford to miss any more trains!
Conversation/THorner01/Line00025=Looks like we found all the Confederate Diamondbacks, Sir. This should really help out against the trains.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00026=Alright Boys, we've taken down enough trains. We get anything interestin' yet?
Conversation/THorner01/Line00027=Sir, one of the trains got through. We can't afford to miss any more trains!
Conversation/THorner01/Line00038=Trains are approaching through the northwest and western tunnels.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00039=Trains are approaching via the western and southern tunnels.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00040=Trains detected leaving the northwest and southern tunnels.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00041=Trains detected coming through the northwest, western, and southern tunnels.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00042=Mind the gap.
Conversation/THorner01/Line00043=The eighteen fifty service to New Gettysburg is running four years, five months, twelve days, eight hours and seventeen minutes late.
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00002=The Dominion's restored power to the old rail network.
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00004=They're using the trains to move salvage to a central processing station. Our informants say the Dominion's found something unusually valuable - and they're transporting it to the processing station today. 
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00006=It's on one of these trains - but unfortunately they're all scan-shielded so we can't tell which one. We'll have to hit as many as we can and hope we get lucky.
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00007='Hope we get lucky?' That ain't the usual Matt Horner plan!
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00008=You got a better one, sir, I'm all ears.  
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00009=It's all good, Matt. You sold me. Well, let's go rob ourselves some trains. Ol' Tychus is gonna love this one!
Conversation/THorner01Briefing/Line00018=Never thought we'd be back to this graveyard again. What've we got, Matt?
Conversation/THorner02/Line00001=Alright boys, we've got a deal with Mira Han! Now let's get to work and get that adjutant back!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00002=Huh, you've already got half the payment I asked for. You're a fast worker, Jim. Send me Matthew and we'll call it even.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00003=Very nice, you're almost there, Jim! I'll get my crew ready for some Orlan-bashing.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00004=Better pick up the pace, Orlan's already got half of my payment waiting for me. You know I've got a soft spot for Matthew, but business is business.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00005=I don't think so darlin'. How about I keep Matt and give you the minerals.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00006=Thank you sir.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00007=Oh Matthew, you hurt my feelings.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00008=Matthew, perhaps you could stop by later? We have some personal business to... discuss.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00009=Here's some scrap we can salvage for extra resources. We need to keep looking for this stuff.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00010=Those shredders are constantly producing scrap we can salvage. We should check this area again later.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00011=Alright, Mira - we both know you're rippin' me off - but I'm gonna hire you anyway. 
Conversation/THorner02/Line00012=Oh you scheming little - ! I'll show you what happens to double-dealing backstabbers.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00013=I got a little present headed your way!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00014=Mira, do me a favor, keep him on ice.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00015=Now let's get that adjutant back to the Hyperion and have ourselves a little chat with her.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00016=Pirates have been stripping down ships here for years, it should be pretty easy to collect enough scrap to pay Mira off.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00017=I left a little present out here for you and Matthew. I never got to give it to him last time you boys were here!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00018=You know I would much rather team up with you and Matthew. But Orlan's nearly got his payment ready -- don't let him win! 
Conversation/THorner02/Line00019=Alright! Alright! I surrender! Just take your damn adjutant already!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00020=I oughta do the universe a favor and put you down, Orlan. It's too bad I might need to hire you some day. 
Conversation/THorner02/Line00021=(chuckles) You got it, Raynor. I will keep the snake safe and sound for you. I will even do it for free!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00022=My forces are yours, Jim. I'm so glad I got to side with you and Matthew!
Conversation/THorner02/Line00023=Damn Jimmy, are those Vulture bikes? 
Conversation/THorner02/Line00024=Good eye, Tychus. We can use 'em to lay mines around our base to hold off Orlan.
Conversation/THorner02/Line00025=I'm... um...
Conversation/THorner02/Line00026=Yes. We should do that.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00001=Deadman's Port. It's risky just waiting here with all these mercenaries around. 
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00002=(Sarcastic) Yep, there we go...
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00003=James. Orlan decrypted your adjutant but he's planning to sell it to the Dominion. Must have been something exciting in there!
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00004=That's nice, Mira, but why are you telling me all this?
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00005=Because I like you and Matthew better than him, of course! Match Orlan's offer and I'll help you take him out instead. He's paying in minerals, so I'll give you the same deal.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00006=(smiles and nods) Done. Always a pleasure, Mira.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00007=It's going to be hard to get minerals down there. We'll have to find salvage if we're going to hire Mira before Orlan does.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00008=Think she'll help Orlan sir?
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00009=She's a mercenary. She'll help whoever pays the most. 
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00010=[Happy 60]Don't take too long now, if Orlan comes up with the goods first I'll have to side with him.[/Happy] [Sad]Oh and, um, say hello to Matthew for me; ask him why he never calls. (laughs)[/Sad]
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00011=Colonel Orlan's sure taking his time decrypting that adjutant for us. 
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00012=He wants me to keep you off his back until they arrive.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00013=Get us down there, Matt. My boot's got an appointment with Orlan's backside.
Conversation/THorner02Briefing/Line00018=Yeah, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00001=I hope you're readin' this, Jimmy, 'cause I'm heading for the last base now!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00002=Well now that's done with, I'm gonna take me a little break.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00003=Good thing I brought me some liquid refreshment...
Conversation/THorner03/Line00004=Huh. That's about all I'd trust you with, Tychus.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00005=Reckon you boys'll need some time to catch up. 
Conversation/THorner03/Line00006=Sweet. You just keep me repaired Jimmy. I'll win this whole war for ya!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00007=Man I need SCV's to fix some of this damage. Startin' to feel a mite sluggish.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00008=I can't wait no longer! Here it comes!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00009=Uh Jimmy? ....Pardner? Can ya hear me?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00010=Well if you ain't going to tell me not to have a little fun...I'm going to have a little fun hehe. Here I go!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00011=Hot Damn! I can't wait to get inside that thing and tear this place up!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00012=Excellent! With the Odin secured we can hit the UNN complex on Korhal and make our broadcast. 
Conversation/THorner03/Line00013=Does he always talk this much, Sir?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00014=Yep, once you get him in a fight he never shuts up.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00015=Scramble more Wraiths from the starport. If we have enough we can handle the battlecruisers.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00016=Hey can ya hear me 'Captain'? Maybe next time you'll trust ol' Tychus with a little bit o' mayhem.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00017=Hold your position Tychus! Let us get a support force up there to cover you!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00018=Now that's what I'm talking about!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00019=C'mon, Jimmy! We got heads to break!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00020=Here we go. I'm hittin' my stride now!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00021=This is going to get tricky...I'm detecting battlecruisers at the next base and the Odin doesn't have strong anti-air capabilities.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00022=BOOM, baby!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00023=This is gonna hurt you a lot more than it's gonna hurt me!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00024=You want some of this?!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00025=Time to kick ass and chew bubble gum!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00026=What is that thing? Swann would love this place.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00029=Activate the auto-turrets!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00030=This ain't a stealth mission any more ladies. Bring it loud and fast!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00031=You ain't keepin' me from that monster!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00032=(Laughs)
Conversation/THorner03/Line00033=I see your little guys running around down there, Jimmy. Heh, they look like ants.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00034=Good old Tychus be right here takin' it easy...(yawns)
Conversation/THorner03/Line00035=Just wake me up when you're ready - I reckon a small nuke oughta do it, hehehe.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00036=Sir, I'm picking up Dominion battlecruisers on an intercept course with the Odin.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00037=So what's the plan now, Commander? Trash them bases right?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00038=Oh you want some of this? Boom!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00039=We should have enough Wraiths to handle them, but let's scramble a couple more just to be sure.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00040=Dammit, Tychus! Stand down! Can you read me?!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00041=(sighs contentedly) Now that hit the spot. There's nothing like knocking back a cold one on top o' yer enemies' smoking corpses!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00042=He's got it stuck on transmit, sir. He can't hear us at all. Defenses are coming online at the Dominion bases.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00043=Wonderful. Get our base set up ASAP. We'll just have to follow him in and hope he doesn't get too crazy. (beat) Ah, who am I kidding...
Conversation/THorner03/Line00044=Y'know, I think I'll take me another breather. You better get some back up ready for me, Jimmy.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00045=Ok, flashy red button what do you do?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00046=DAMN! Now that is HOT!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00047=Now that was fun! Don't worry, old buddy, I'll give you some time to catch up.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00048=Three bases down, maybe the convict has his uses after all.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00049=You reckon these Dominion boys'll put up a fight this time? I ain't barely broke a sweat.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00050=Hey now, that ain't fair!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00051=The Odin is in range, fire the Yamato cannon!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00052=Hello there, now how'd I miss this button with a skull on it?
Conversation/THorner03/Line00053=Nuclear launch detected.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00054=Oh baby! You're in for a world of pain!
Conversation/THorner03/Line00055=Hey hotshot, you want these Wraith fighters now? They'll take down a battlecruiser easy. You can build more at a starport.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00056=Well I'll be, those Dominion egg heads really thoughta everything. Pardon me a moment.
Conversation/THorner03/Line00057=There we go. Heh. You ready yet?
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00001=Our team's in position, we're ready to steal the Odin.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00002=We can't risk word of this getting back to Korhal.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00003=Ready to rock!
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00004=Hopefully we can block all transmissions long enough for him to do that.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00005=He does get a little excited in combat, we're gonna need to keep up with him once the fightin' starts.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00012=Are you absolutely sure about this, sir?
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00013=Yep. Tychus is definitely our best man for this kind of job.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00014=If he can actually commandeer the Odin, it's vital that we take out all the Dominion bases in the area. 
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00015=How much do we know about this 'Odin'?
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00016=It's an experimental super-heavy siege walker designed for prolonged front line combat. Very powerful.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00017=Great, even Tychus can't wreck it then.
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00018=Here they go-
Conversation/THorner03Briefing/Line00019=Go! Go! Go!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00001=This mighty steel giant stands as a testimony to the skill and determination of our Dominion engineers and scientists!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00002=Kill team Mad Dogs, destroy the Odin!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00003=Our base is up and running. I'm transferring control of it to you now, sir.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00004=Reaperman engaging rogue Odin!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00005=The Dominion's switched to a secure channel. I can't track their positions anymore. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00006=But I have gained access to the UNN network. We'll need troops to stay close to one of the broadcast towers long enough to get our message out. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00007=You can bet Mengsk'll have something to say about that. Let's get moving.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00008= All transmissions have been sent, Sir. Every world in the Dominion just got a 'UNN special bulletin' about Mengsk.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00009= Let's get out of here. We can enjoy the results from a nice, safe distance.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00010=I'm in the Dominion security network. Bringing up their locations now.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00011=Alright,Tychus - do your thing.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00012=Thought you'd never ask. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00013=An alert's gone out! It won't be long before they shut me out of their system.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00014=Don't rush me, kid. Can't a man take some pleasure in his work?
Conversation/THorner04/Line00015=We're almost out of time! 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00016=So are these guys! Heh -- don't sweat it.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00017=What the hell's going on!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00018=Odin has gone rogue. Repeat -- Odin has gone rogue!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00019=Bring it down!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00020=Scrap that heap!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00021=This thing is outta juice! I gotta eject!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00022=Rogue Odin spotted. Bring it down!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00023=For our broadcast to reach all of Dominion space we'll need to control each broadcast tower long enough to upload the data. Any unit type can maintain control.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00024=First transmission uploaded...Even Mengsk won't be able to wriggle out of this one.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00025=Behold the Dominion's newest weapon of war - the Odin!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00026=Implacable. Relentless. Invincible. The Odin is a stirring symbol of the unyielding strength of the Terran Dominion!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00027=We're almost done transmitting Mengsk's dirty little secret to the Dominion.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00028= That's the last one! Let's see what the people will think of their beloved emperor now!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00030=Concentrate fire on the Odin!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00031=Attention rogue pilot. This is General Warfield of Dominion command. You are ordered to stand down or face immediate termination.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00032=Human tenacity and ingenuity have come together to forge the final answer to the zerg threat!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00033=Some might baulk at the cost of such a magnificent machine, but I say to you - what price do you put on your loved ones' security? 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00036=Kill Team Death Dealers, retire that Odin for me!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00037=The Odin is still standing? Take it down! Now!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00038=There's only one man arrogant enough to think he can get away with this - Raynor!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00039=Hah. Just for once Arcturus, this really is all about you. I hope you enjoy our show.
Conversation/THorner04/Line00040=I knew it. Warfield! Get your men down there. I want Raynor's head, you understand!? Him and all his terrorist friends!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00041=Man, I am so sick of seeing Mengsk's face! Tychus, do me a favor and blast any of those damned statues you see. 
Conversation/THorner04/Line00042=Security breach at one of the towers. Strike team Alpha, engage! Stop them!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00043=They're attacking a tower. Strike team Bravo, take them out!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00044=Strike team Charlie, get to that tower! Bring down those rebels!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00045=Hardware inbound. These Thors are smaller than the Odin but they handle better -- and they still hit hard. Enjoy!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00047=That big dog is all mine!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00051=What's wrong with that thing! It's gone crazy!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00052=Find some place to hide!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00053=It's gonna kill us all! Help!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00054=It's making pot holes!
Conversation/THorner04/Line00055=It's gone crazy! Run!
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00001=Our raid on the Valhalla facility hasn't even been reported yet. The Dominion have no idea we stole the Odin. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00002=So they're still expecting to film it at the UNN studios later today?
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00003=That's right -- and we won't disappoint them. Seeing as he's the only one with experience, Tychus will pilot the Odin and hit the studio guards with a surprise attack. They'll be confused for several minutes - and won't even know who to attack at first. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00004=And during the confusion, we'll establish a forward base using this command center we 'acquired' earlier. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00005=Keep in mind -- we'll only have a few minutes before the Dominion realize that Tychus is in the Odin. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00006=Once they figure it out they'll use everything they've got to stop us.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00007=Whatever happens, we'll be givin' Mengsk one hell of a broadcast. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00008=Pretty devious, Matt. I like it. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00009=Let's do this. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00010=I had to call in every favor I had, but I got the Odin on the surface, with Tychus inside.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00011=If Tychus can inflict enough damage during the sneak attack, making the broadcast should be relatively easy. 
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00012=Matt, you're a miracle worker. It must have been a complicated operation.
Conversation/THorner04Briefing/Line00013=You don't even want to know sir. I'm not going to let anything keep us from exposing Mengsk.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00001=Sir, parts of the facility seem to be scan-shielded...our signals are breaking up left and right. Be careful in there. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00002=Hey, careful's my middle name. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00003=I thought it was Eugene...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00004=Shut it, Matt. Alright, boys - stay frosty!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00005=This facility is strictly off limits - Raynor?! Halt, you're under arrest! 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00006=Not today, Buddy.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00007=These creatures...they ain't like any zerg I've ever seen before. Matt, scan their bio-signatures.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00008=Hold on...the signal's weak in there. Wait. Sir -- I'm reading both zerg and protoss DNA. Were those... things assimilated somehow? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00009=I don't know. But I'm real curious as to what they're doing inside a Dominion lab. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00010=They were testing these weapons...on the specimens. What the hell have they been up to here? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00011=Looks like the same creature was mutated and cloned over and over. Matt, you got any additional info? 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00012=Stetmann's been running some tests, sir. He says the specimens' DNA strands have been artificially spliced. Whoever's in charge of this mess did it deliberately. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00013=Oh my Lord. Am I seein' this right?
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00014=Containment field weakening. Protoss/zerg hybrid reviving. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00015=Hybrid? We should get out of here right now...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00016=Alright, that's it. We're leaving! 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00017=Sir, you'll have to be careful. Signal's warping, but that critter's breaking the place apart! Who knows what you'll run into! 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00018=Just what I wanted to hear. Thanks for the head's up. Stay tight on me! Let's move, Raiders!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00019=Matt, can you read me? I'm inbound in some big transport the Dominion was nice enough to supply. Don't shoot us down!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00020=You got it, sir! But why would the Dominion even want to create something as monstrous as that Hybrid?
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00021=I don't know... but I have a real bad feeling it ain't the last we'll see of it.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00022=Hm. Fry any rebel you see!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00023=Surprise, surprise, the door's sealed. Nothing a little breaching charge won't cure.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00024=Looks like we got a reception committee waitin' for us. Adjutant, activate those gun turrets and give 'em a surprise!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00025=Check it out, we got that Raynor guy trapped in lab one. 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00026=Zerg! They're coming from the holding pen! Destroy it, boys, we gotta block 'em out! 
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00027=They got out! That ain't good...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00028=Hold 'em back! Don't let 'em in the lab!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00029=Looks like we got a few options on this terminal to soften 'em up before we go in.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00030='Chrono Rift Device'? Must be based on alien tech. Mengsk is really playing with fire here.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00032=Ha, nice. Release the zerg!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00033=We got trouble ahead, that cargo bay's big enough for heavy units.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00034=What th -
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00035=Oh yeah. Siege tanks...Vikings...Wait...Some kinda warbot? Looks like I can pick a weapon upgrade and activate it from this console. Here goes...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00036=That bot won't last long, let's move!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00037=You reading me, Matt? I could use some reinforcements down here. They got something big in the next room and I don't think it's friendly.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00038=You got it, sir. I only have one dropship available. What do you need?
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00039=Brutalisk, huh? So the Dominion's doing research on these things too. Mean looking sucker...
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00040=System accessed. Decrypting security overrides. System control established.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00041=Well... I'm picking up a strong power signature close to you. There must be a large fusion reactor somewhere in the facility.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00042=C'mon ladies, we need to keep movin'. Blast through that rubble!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00043=Ah hell, that debris won't hold it for long! Keep moving! Go! GO!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00044=The hybrid is on the move!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00045=Another Warbot! Adjutant, send it after the hybrid to buy us some time!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00046=Let's move!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00047=Hell, that warbot didn't last long!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00048=This place is coming apart fast!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00049=Sir! I lost the Hybrid's signal. It seemed to just... disappear.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00050=Define "disappear."
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00051=Whoa! What the hell!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00052=This might not be the best time to take on a giant zerg monster, but Stetmann still needs more Brutalisk samples to complete his research. It's your call.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00053=Yes, sir. Your reinforcements are inbound.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00055=Oh my God, don't kill me!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00056=Aahhhh!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00057=Raynor's Raiders!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00058=We need to get out of here!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00059=Containment breach!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00060=Emergency! Emergency!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00061=Don't set it loose!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00062=We're all gonna die!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00063=Time we were leaving! Lift off!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00064=Matt, we've gotta blow this place sky high. No way we can just leave it standing.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00065=Watch yourselves guys, don't get split up.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00066=Perfect. We'll find the reactor, destroy it, then we're outta here!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00067=Evac! Get to the transport!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00068=Transport? I think we just found our way out of here!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00069=Sir! If I'm reading this right that hybrid is virtually indestructible, don't try and fight it - just get out of there!
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00070=Well he did his best for us.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00072=Everything in there is hostile. Whatever I free, I'm gonna end up fightin'.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00078=Well, we got half the guns. Should take some of 'em out at least.
Conversation/THorner05S/Line00079=Sir, you're right on top of that power signature -- the fusion reactor must be nearby.
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00001=So what's the scoop on this top-secret death-lab?
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00002=Let's hope so. We'd look pretty silly comin' all this way for a few tons of Beryllium.
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00005=Did those documents give us any clues as to what the Dominion's cookin' up in there?
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00007=Sounds fun.
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00008=This asteroid is registered as a Beryllium Storage warehouse, but that must be a cover for the Dominion's bio-lab.
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00010=Well, 'long as we're here, we may as well take a look. 
Conversation/THorner05SBriefing/Line00011=No sir. But they did contain some of the facility's security codes, so we may be able to hack into their systems.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00001=Raynor's Raiders! Damn rebels - we got enough problems 'round here as it is! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00003=(to himself) The Dominion's got these folks terrified. 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00004=Hey, you boys ain't the Dominion! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00005=Marshal Raynor. Been a while since we saw you around here.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00006=Careful, there's a curfew in effect!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00007=Friends, with our official labor programs, everyone can help to build a better tomorrow! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00010=Commander, a large Dominion force is gathering in the center of town.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00011=Then it's time to call in that 'special delivery' we talked about.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00012=Work hard. Stand proud. We must all sacrifice for the glory of the Dominion! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00013=Keep a close watch on your neighbors. Dissent will only slow our progress. 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00014=Lots of folks go in, don't ever come back.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00015=What's wrong with you people? Why don't ya fight back? 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00016=Damn Raynor! We still have to live here! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00017=Get back in your houses!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00018=Korhal is the heart of the Dominion, but the common man is the heart of the future!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00019=Commander, there are tutorial videos awaiting your review.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00020=You'll all be given a meal when you reach the dig site.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00021=You're in violation! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00022=No sacrifice is too great for safeguarding our communities...
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00023=Commander, destroying the Dominion Holoboards will help incite rebellion against the Dominion.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00024=Commander, destroying the Dominion property will help incite rebellion against the Dominion.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00025=Your freedoms must be protected!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00026=My brother went off to the mine last week. He disappeared!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00027=Raynor? Kill him!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00028=Alright boys, let's show the locals they don't need to fear the Dominion.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00029=I'm gettin' mighty tired of seein' Mengsk's face! Blast it! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00030=Keep your intervals wide, your eyes open and your asses covered. Let's move!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00031=Labor redistribution mandates may require you to serve your term in areas all across the Dominion! 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00032=Relocation? 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00033=Don't go up that road.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00034=Why? What's waitin' for us?
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00035=Stay away.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00036=That's Raynor! Most wanted man in the Dominion!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00037=Where is everyone?
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00038=This is starting to look ugly.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00039=Alright. Reinforcements!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00040=Get a med-pack and help this man. What happened here? Tell me... Dammit, he's gone.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00041=They can't just take us away from our families, can they?
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00042=This is bad.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00043=Finally. There's the locals!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00044=Mengsk has a lot to pay for.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00045=Jim Raynor!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00046=We got a runner!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00047=Now listen up. It's time you all stood up for yourselves. Now I'm takin' down that base. You're all welcome to join me.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00048=Thank you Raynor! We knew you wouldn't forget us!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00049=My neighbors. My family...
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00050=There's more people still bein' held up ahead!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00051=I'll see to them.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00052=Now you've got the weapons and the resources to do it. Remember, Mengsk can only control you if you let him.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00053=I didn't think we could fight them. But we can!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00054=This is a restricted area! You insurgents are under arrest!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00055=Well, this ain't good. 
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00056=We're with ya, Raiders!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00057=I'd like to see him try.
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00058=Down with Mengsk!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00059=Screw the Dominion!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00061=We got yer' back, Raynor!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00062=They're shooting civilians! Move in!
Conversation/TRaynor01/Line00065=I don't think I'll let you arrest me today, officer.
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00006=Adjutant, what do ya got for me?
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00010=Dominion forces have set up a logistics headquarters in the town of Backwater Station.
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00011=This has become the hub for all operations on Mar Sara. The Dominion recently pulled troops out of the city, and they are now understrength.
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00012=Are the locals cooperating?
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00013=The people of Backwater Station are known to be anti-Dominion. But they lack weapons and organization.
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00014=If I can take that headquarters away from Mengsk, it'll cripple him on this planet.
Conversation/TRaynor01Briefing/Line00015=Prep my ship.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00001=Commander, additional tutorials are available for you to review.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00003=We'll need a lot more marines before we take on the Dominion outpost. Train 'em up at the Barracks.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00006=Commander, the Dominion is attacking the rebel base to the southwest!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00007=Good! That'll keep the Dominion off our backs.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00009=Nice job cleaning out that bunker, Jimmy. Between your boys and my skills we are gonna go a long way together.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00012=Go get that base!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00013=Raynor's the man!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00014=Rebel scum!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00023=Dominion can go to hell!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00024=Kick the Dominion's ass!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00028=Help! Somebody save me!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00031=Warning. Dominion Hellions approaching...
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00034=You guys sure are a welcome sight! We're with you. Just tell us where you want us.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00035=Welcome aboard, boys.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00037=While we're at it, extra SCVs will help us harvest minerals faster. Train 'em up at the Command Center.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00042=The Dominion ain't stupid, Jimmy, you best keep some boys back to defend your base.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00043=It's Raynor's boys!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00044=Bad guys are thatta way!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00045=Go get 'em!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00052=Outstanding, with their barracks and factory trashed we just gotta mop up any stragglers and we're home free.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00065=Those folks need our help, Tychus. There's no way we're leavin' 'em to rot!
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00066=Crane controls accessed. Decrypting security overrides. Crane control established.
Conversation/TRaynor02/Line00067=Beautiful, now let's reel that sucker in and get out of here!
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00001=This old outpost don't look like anything special.
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00002=Keep your shirt on, son. Dominion engineers've been digging out here for months.
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00003=See that crane? They're getting ready to move the artifact they found off-world.
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00004=Well I'll be damned...
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00005=See? You gotta have a little more faith, Jimmy.
Conversation/TRaynor02Briefing/Line00006=Alright. Time to give the Dominion a wake-up call. Let's smash that base and haul that baby out of there.
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00001=Mayday! Mayday! We're trapped by the zerg! They're burrowed all around us! If you can reach us, please help! 
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00002=Man, are you a sight for sore eyes. Hold up! We're comin'  with ya!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00003=To anyone hearing this message, we're pinned down near Backwater Station! Please assist!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00004=Thought we were goners there!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00005=We need immediate support! Hostiles all around us. Is anyone out there?
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00006=Commander, this is Matt Horner. Just hold on! Cavalry's on the way!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00007=Take your time, Matt. No rush!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00008=Here they come! Lock and load!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00009=We're gettin' tore up out there. We gotta fall back to higher ground!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00010=Good to see ya, Matt! Welcome to the party.
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00011=Get some SCVs repairing those bunkers!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00012=Cavalry's arrived! Anyone still alive down there?
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00013=Multiple air bogies detected! ETA: Right the hell now!!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00014=Zerg are hitting us from the west!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00015=We got zerg coming in from the east!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00016=Thanks for the assist! We're with you, Raynor!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00017=Hold out just a little longer! We'll be getting outta here soon!
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00018=Glad we made it in time, sir. Now let's get you boys outta there.
Conversation/TRaynor03/Line00019=Keep at it boys, our ride's on its way.
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00001=I've got transport coming to pick us up, all we gotta do is sit tight.
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00002=Don't sound too hard. I figure we earned ourselves a little R&R --
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00003=Commander, I'm detecting a massive concentration of zerg bio-signatures landing at the abandoned dig site.
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00004=[Surprise 70]I shoulda known it![/Surprise] [Angry]Damn you, Tychus![/Angry]
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00005=I swear, man - I didn't know nothin' about no zerg!
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00006=Given their current course, the zerg will overrun this location within the hour.
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00007=Hell... We gotta hold out long enough for extraction. 
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00008=If we man the bunkers and hold those two bridges as long as we can we just might stand a chance. 
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00009=We're gonna have a real fight on our hands here.
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00010=(dismissive) I been in plenty of hold-outs before...
Conversation/TRaynor03Briefing/Line00011=(grim) Not against the zerg, you ain't.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00001=Lava's rising, get those SCVs to high ground right now!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00002=Reapers you say? Hell, cowboy, we gotta train more of these guys, they're seriously bad ass!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00003=Your men work fast. We've already got half the minerals we need.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00004=Almost done, Mr. Raynor. Just a few more minerals to go.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00005=Ah, sir! Sir! Ah scanners show a large bio-signature close to your position - a Brutalisk I think! If you could kill it that'd get my...err our research off to a flying start!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00008=This counter shows the estimated time until the next lava surge. Move all units and structures to high ground when a surge is imminent.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00009=Alert. Zerg approaching. Defenses required. Expended minerals will diminish the mining quota, so caution is advised.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00010=Seismic activity is increasing. Caution is advised.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00012=I got some friends comin' to help you out - Reapers. 
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00013=Alert. Lava surge imminent. Evacuate low ground immediately.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00016=Just a reminder sir; the more minerals we expend on forces, the longer it's going to take to reach our goal. Try to be economical.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00017=Damn, losing all those SCVs is gonna set us back. I'm gonna call in some reinforcements.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00018=Sir, command centers aren't cheap. We don't have any more replacements so try and be more careful with this one .
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00037=All clear. It is now safe to proceed with mining operations.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00040=Some of my boys disappeared in this area. Wanna see if they're still alive.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00041=Tosh sent ya to help? About time! Let's finish up this contract and get the hell off this planet.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00046=Since you're doin' right by me - I'll do right by you. Here's the coordinates of the nearest mineral nodes.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00047=I scanned for mineral outcrops before we landed. Sending more data to you now.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00048=Doin' well there, Mr. Raynor. We got traces of more minerals over on the other side of the canyon.
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00066=Alright boys, nice work. We got what we came for. Now lets get outta this hellhole!
Conversation/TTosh01/Line00067=Finished already? You really are as good as they say Mr. Raynor. I'm thinking you and I got a lot more business we can be talking about.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00001=(distorted) Good to see you made it. They call me Tosh. You help me mine the minerals I need
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00002=Redstone. Heck of a place. 
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00003=What's the catch?
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00004=I ever mention how much I hate volcanic planets?
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00005=Of course that's where the richest mineral nodes are found. But that'll be no problem for a big tough guy like you.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00006=We'll need to spend some of what we mine just to defend the operation. The more we spend, the longer this is gonna take.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00007= and I'll make it worth your while.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00008=(resigned) Let's do this.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00010=Well, this place is a little...unstable. The low ground gets flooded with lava every few minutes.
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00011=Sir, I'm also picking up zerg bio-signatures on the surface. 
Conversation/TTosh01Briefing/Line00012=Huh, lava and zerg - two of my favorite things.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00001=Our SCVs can pick up terrazine canisters and move 'em. It'll take 'em a while to disconnect the canister so make sure you watch out for 'em.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00002=Here are the coordinates for the terrazine sites, brother. This should make our lives a little easier.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00003=Bold move, Mr. Raynor, collecting terrazine from two places at once!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00004=Sure, it's gonna be harder to keep the Tal'darim off our backs, but the quicker we're done here the sooner we can get off this rock.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00005=The protoss are mobilizing, sir. Looks like they're gonna go after our SCVs when we harvest the terrazine. I suggest we only harvest one site at a time and run with a heavy escort.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00006=I've got the first canister unhooked, sir! I'll take it to the nearest command center...
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00007=These reckless terrans must be stopped! Slay them all!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00010=This land was sacred to the Tal'darim before terrans ever reached the stars! You must depart immediately!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00011=Hold on now. We just need some of this gas here, and we'll be long gone before you know it.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00012=No! You shall not defile the Breath of Creation! Tal'darim warriors, execute all those who would desecrate our altars!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00013=Good job! That's the first canister filled.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00014=Sir, our SCVs are getting hammered out there! We need a stronger escort or static defences to protect them.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00015=You shall not steal the Breath of Creation so easily!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00016=Three down. You're doing great! Keep it up!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00017=That's over half the canisters you wanted.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00018=You and your Raiders sure can walk the walk! We just need one more canister.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00019=This ain't good. If the Tal'darim seal off any more terrazine, there won't be enough left for us!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00020=Damn those Tal'darim! Every altar they shut down sets us back further. You need to get some of your boys out there and stop them!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00021=We gotta slow the Tal'darim down some! They've sealed off five geysers already!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00022=Wonderful. The Tal'darim are sealing off the terrazine altars so we can't get at 'em! If they keep it up we won't be able to collect enough.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00023=Careful! They're sending their ships to take out your SCV's! Shoot 'em down quick or we're finished!
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00024=Warning. The Tal'darim are sealing off a terrazine altar.
Conversation/TTosh02/Line00066=That's the last canister! I think we've outstayed our welcome, boys!
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00001=Here we go.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00002=If these Tal'darim bring in their air power they're gonna hammer us.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00003=Not just any old protoss - fanatics called the Tal'darim. They believe the terrazine is sacred, a gift from the Xel'Naga. 
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00004=I don't much like fightin' protoss if I can avoid it.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00005=Swann, get the Goliath schematics loaded at the factory. If their anti-air missiles are still any good, we might just pull this off.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00006=See those altars? Tal'darim mystics set them up to collect the terrazine. We just need to grab it.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00007=Well, our SCVs'll be able to haul the terrazine. We just got to keep 'em protected.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00008=With any luck we can pick up what we need before the Tal'darim find us.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00009=How do we get to the terrazine?
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00010=Alright, cowboy. I'll get the Goliath schematics loaded so we can build more.
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00011=Much prettier than Redstone, yeah?
Conversation/TTosh02Briefing/Line00012=Alright, let's get to it.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00001=Remember - just keep sending in troops and I'll do the rest.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00002=Don't you worry about us, Tosh. We'll keep 'em busy while you free the prisoners!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00003=Good work, Tosh! We're pushing on toward the front line.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00004=See if you can slow down the Dominion so we can build up some defenses.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00005=Tosh, you're nearing the first military cell block now. Releasing the prisoners might buy us some allies.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00006=We're rollin' now! Keep 'em busy while we establish our forward position! 
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00007=Nice work, Tosh, freeing those prisoners will really help us out. 
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00008=Now those boys are free we can bust this place wide open, great job, Tosh!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00009=And the walls come tumblin' down! Be free my brothers and sisters! Your new life awaits! (laughs) 
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00010=Tosh, we've got a Nuke ready for launch. Paint a target!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00011=There's another Nuke ready for you, Tosh! Just give us a target.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00012=We've got another Nuke ready to go! What's the target?
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00013=You're close to the second military cell block, Tosh. Feel like making some new friends?
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00014=We got another Nuke for ya, Tosh! Designate a target, and we'll drop it right where you want it.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00015=We've got trouble back here, Tosh. Sure could use your help cleaning it up.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00016=The Dominion are pushing us back. We're gonna lose the forward base at this rate!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00017=The Dominion's right on our doorstep, Tosh! Get back here and give us a hand!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00018=The Dominion's all over us, Tosh! We need some backup!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00019=Outstanding!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00020=That turret across the bridge.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00021=With my cloaking abilities, I can take out all these guards. They'll never see me.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00022=It can see me, and alert its allies if I get too close, even with my stealth.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00023=I can use a psionic explosion to take out groups of marines. A little trick I call mindblast.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00024=When I need energy I can use Consumption to get more. I just steal a little life from an ally.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00025=The more life they have, the more energy.  It don't hurt. Much.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00026=Just don't call the strike in too close.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00027=Hang in there Tosh. My boys are movin' in to back you up.
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00028=Time for some payback!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00030=Raynor's Raiders! I could kiss you guys!
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00036=You just unleashed a nightmare on all of us, Raynor! Heaven help you now.  
Conversation/TTosh03A/Line00037=The prison entrance is up ahead. Keep up the pressure! We're almost there!
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00001=Uploading New Folsom data now. Feast your eyes on this, brother.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00002=They're locked down tight. Nova must have tipped them off. We're gonna need an army to break into that place now.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00003=Even an army couldn't get you in there. But one man - one Spectre in the right place - can find a way in.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00004=Then our progress is all up to you, Tosh. I'll push my boys as hard as I can, but they're gonna need your help to gain ground.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00005=Sure. You sit back this time. I'll take the lead and clear the way. Just keep sending troops to keep the pressure on, an' I'll do the rest. 
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00006=There's a Dominion base right by the main prison entrance. Take that out and the guards will retreat.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00007=Alright Tosh, you ready for this?  
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00008=I been waitin' a long time for this. I'm ready.  
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00009=The prisoners can handle it from there.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00010=There are two cell blocks containing military prisoners outside the main compound. If we break those open, we could probably count on help from the inmates.
Conversation/TTosh03ABriefing/Line00011=What else?
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00001=Nice work, boys. Our next target is the Terrazine tanks.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00002=I'll clear a landing zone for you. Get ready.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00003=Good job, Jim!  One more to go!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00004=That Psi-Indoctrinator's heavily guarded. Nuking it's gonna be our best bet.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00005=Relax. I just need to take out the gate control on the other side.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00006=See? Nice and easy! Let's move.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00007=I'm pinned down over here! Help a girl out and take down those guys on the top of the cliff! 
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00008=Careful - there's a siege tank up ahead. If I can get close enough, I can telepathically dominate the crew.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00009=Tosh just... Somehow he got past us, Sir.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00010=Don't worry about it, Matt. We did what we came here to do.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00011=Spectres! Let me handle them.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00012=I'm telling you I saw something! 
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00013=We should just cover the place in auto turrets! That'll find 'em.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00014=And see if they can't get this gate open! Time's a-wasting.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00015=Gonna need your help with this gate, Nova. 
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00016=Ok, here we go. Stay sharp boys - Tosh might have some nasty surprises waiting for us.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00017=See that Marauder up ahead? Fifty credits says I can snipe him from here!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00018=Now why did you have to go and do that? You're testing me, brother... Testing me hard.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00019=Keep me covered while I hack into this nuke silo. 
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00020=Check out that high ground, Nova! There should be some good angles up there.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00021=L.Z. secured. You can begin your landing, Jim.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00022=Never took you for a traitor. You've fallen a long, long way, brother.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00023=You ain't training any more psychopaths at this base.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00024=Your pretty little ghost been chasin' me a long time, and she hasn't caught me yet.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00025=Ghost!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00026=(threatening) This ain't the end. I'll be seeing you again real soon.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00027=I'm sending down another Raven.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00028=Where is she?
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00029=Taking damage! Damn ghost is here somewhere.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00030=Bugging out!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00031=Let's get out of here!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00032=I'm sending in more Reapers. They're on their way now.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00033=The gate's open! Let's make some noise!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00034=I have a present for you, Mr Raynor. Best start runnin'!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00035=Tosh isn't paying us enough to fight a ghost.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00036=Air-cav has arrived! Give us a target!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00037=I'm gettin' tired of this. Why don't you just DIE!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00038=You're right, Raynor. A well-placed nuke would wreak some serious havoc on those defenses.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00039=Let's just bug out and call it even.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00040=That's it!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00041=Should just... take... a f... there!
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00042=Dominated units will remain under Nova's control until she releases them.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00043=While units are Dominated, Nova is free to move and attack as normal.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00044=Dominated units will remain under Nova's control until the timer runs out.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00045=An Ultralisk? Tosh sure keeps some exotic pets.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00046=Nuclear missile ready.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00047=I ain't your brother. You're a murdering psychopath.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00048=You working for Mengsk now, brother. How does it feel?
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00049=Nova will just stab you in the back, Raynor. It's what she does.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00050=Sendin' your men into my station. You just gonna get 'em all killed.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00051=Better men than you have tried to kill me Raynor. An' I'm still standin'.
Conversation/TTosh03B/Line00052=I've got detection everywhere, brother. You can't run, you can't hide.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00001=So this is where Tosh plans on building his Spectre army.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00002=I've identified three facilities that are vital to his operation. 
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00003=Our first target will be the Jorium stockpile...
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00004=Next will be the Terrazine tanks...
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00005=And finally the psionic waveform indoctrinator Tosh uses to complete the Spectres' activation process.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00006=Alright, so we destroy all three of those targets and Tosh is out of business.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00007=Tosh knows every trick in the book when it comes to infiltration. I can penetrate most of his defenses, but I'll need your backup to get through them all.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00008=And what about Tosh?
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00009=Just leave him to me.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00010=Let's get this party started.
Conversation/TTosh03BBriefing/Line00012=I've cleared a landing zone for your forces.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00001=Kerrigan. 
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00002=I forgot how resourceful you were, Jim. I won't make that mistake twice. 
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00003=I got something new for ya, Cowboy! Marauders - the latest word in big badda boom hardware.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00005=I ain't sure this is the best time to be experimenting, Swann.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00006=Pfft. 'Best time there is! Let the Marauders loose against those Stalkers and you'll see. 
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00009=Hey, you ain't gonna leave your base completely undefended are you, Jimmy?
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00010=Warning. Incoming zerg attack wave detected.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00011=I got a crew coming down to pick up the artifact!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00012=What the - !?
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00013=I'm picking up emanations from protoss relics close by. Stetmann has requested we collect as many as possible to assist in his research.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00016=Warning. Protoss Stalkers are gathering at our perimeter.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00040=This is crazy, man! We can't take the zerg in a stand-up fight, and you know it!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00041=(snarls) Leave the tactics to me, Tychus.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00045=The zerg severely outnumber the protoss forces. It is likely the protoss will fall shortly.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00046=Well here's the plan.Then we've gotta get that artifact before the zerg overrun the whole place!
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00050=Warning - the zerg have almost reached the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00052=Warning! The zerg have begun extracting the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus01/Line00067=We got what we came for! Let's high-tail it out of here!
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00001=Ah, hell.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00002=Them critters were just hiding underground, waitin'?
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00003=No idea. But you can bet they're headed straight for our shrine!
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00006=Well, that sure complicates things. We can't fight two armies at once, partner...
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00007=With any luck we won't have to. 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00008=We only need to hold the area at the top of the shrine long enough to extract the artifact. 
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00009=It's only a matter of time before the zerg overwhelm the protoss. We'd best grab the artifact and be long gone by then.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00010=So we'll land here and cut our way through the protoss lines while they're busy with the zerg.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00011=There it is, Jimmy, just like Moebius said. Easy money.
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00012=I don't know. There's a lot of protoss down there. We're gonna have to - what the?
Conversation/TTychus01Briefing/Line00014=Warning! Multiple zerg bio-signatures detected! 
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00001=More terran thieves? The mysteries of this place are forbidden! You will pay for your transgression with your lives!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00002=Ok, 'least we know what happened to the other expedition.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00003=Hold up there! Those protoss cannons will tear us a new one if we try to advance. Swann? You promised me siege tanks! Where are they?
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00004=Settle down, hotshot. They're comin'. These babies'll knock those cannons down from a nice, safe distance.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00005=These new siege tanks work just like the old ones. When you put 'em in siege mode they get increased range and firepower.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00006=They can't move in siege mode, so if you need to reposition 'em, just switch 'em back into tank mode. Y'got it?
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00007=What do we care, long as the pay's good.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00008=Fire it up! One hundred and seventy four gigawatts - 'the power of the sun at your fingertips.' Now get it aimed at that door and let's get cuttin'!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00009=We need bunkers and siege tanks defending that laser drill! We've got no chance of claiming the artifact without it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00010=Hey hey hey! We need that damn drill! Don't trash it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00011=Get an SCV to repair that laser drill! We're gonna need it to get to the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00012=Those are our guys! Careful with that thing!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00013=The laser drill has breached the door's outer layer.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00014=Let's get some siege tanks deployed on the high ground! They can pound that protoss Stalker before it even gets close to us.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00015=Really? I'd say gettin' vaporized by the Tal'darim definitely counts as 'diminishing returns.'
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00016=Alright. You heard the man! Swing that laser around! We can use it to drive back the protoss!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00017=What's wrong? Just use the laser to blast these protoss freaks!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00018=We need guards by the laser drill! The protoss are hitting it hard!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00019=Those freaks are smashing up the laser! Do something!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00020=Protect the laser drill! We can't let them destroy it!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00021=We need some guns around the drill! Lose it and we're screwed!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00022=The laser drill is now cutting through the door's thermal barrier.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00023=You would desecrate that which belongs to the gods? This will NOT be borne by the faithful!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00024=Thermal barrier breached. The laser drill is now cutting through the core.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00025=Still you persist! It is heresy to touch the artifacts of the Benefactor!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00026=Breach of the doorway core is imminent. Structure access imminent.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00027=They seek to befoul the legacy of the gods! Destroy them!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00028=It is our sacred duty to stop these defilers! Burn them to ashes!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00029=Alert. Enemy air units on approach vector.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00030=Damn it. Air units nothin' - those're transports! Use the laser and knock 'em down fast!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00031=Sir! More air units inbound!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00032=We gotta take them out or they'll keep dropping troops right on top of us!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00033=There's another wave of air units heading your way!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00034=These guys just won't give it up... Stick it to 'em boys!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00035=Sir, I'm picking up the energy signatures of several protoss relics in the area. I'm marking them on your map.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00036=Well if there's time we can blast 'em free with the laser drill  - I bet Stetmann'd love to study them.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00037=Sir, the Tal'darim are mobilizing their forces against us.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00038=Sir, I've managed to access what's left of the Moebius expedition's sensor net. I'll route it through your map so you can see what the Tal'darim are up to.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00039=Laser output is good. Drilling will take some time but there's no other way into the temple. 
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00040=Moebius base local-net accessed. Decrypting security overrides. Transferring control of base structures to you, Commander.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00041=So we set a perimeter and protect the drill until we're through. I'm just glad we've got siege tanks...
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00042=Sir, those are protoss archons. If they get too close our men won't stand a chance!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00043=I'm giving you manual control of the laser drill - see if you can use it against the protoss!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00044=The Tal'darim just can't stand up to our firepower, they're in full retreat! Well done, sir!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00045=Commander. A large Tal'darim force is moving in to attack.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00046=Sir, looks like these protoss are a radical group of fanatics calling themselves the Tal'darim.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00048=Watch your corners, boys. We don't know who cleaned this place out.
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00066=You have prevailed for now. Word of this sacrilege will echo across the stars, James Raynor. The day of reckoning draws near!
Conversation/TTychus02/Line00067=These artifacts of yours seem real popular, Tychus. 
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00001=Attention. Class ten fusion power source detected. 
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00002=Reckon we'll find out soon enough, partner.  
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00003=We just gotta get that sucker working again, and its easy money from there.
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00004=I hate to think about what could have wiped 'em out.  
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00007=So here's the deal. This place is a morgue. Whatever used to live in these ruins up an' died millions of years ago.
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00009=Before they went missin', the Moebius team reported artifact radiation emanating from that big ol' hunk o' rock over yonder. They brought a big damn laser drill to burn their way in. 
Conversation/TTychus02Briefing/Line00011=Laser drill? That thing's a monster. If the Moebius team had access to that kinda hardware...
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00001=I don't plan on stayin' long, Darlin'. But I'll be damned before I let you get a hold of those artifacts. 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00003=Analysis of the Queen of Blades' search pattern complete. Calculating her ETA to the closest data core now.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00004=Confirmed - the final data core has been destroyed! We should evacuate immediately! 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00005=I'm giving you control of our Medivacs, Commander. You can use them to transport your men around the city and avoid most of the zerg.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00007=What are you up to, Jim? 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00008=I can sense you're trying to keep something from me.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00009=Sir, another Nydus worm has emerged close to our base!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00010=Ready for dust off.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00011=That's one down! Keep it moving, boys!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00012=Watch it! Lurker! Those bastards attack while they're burrowed - we need some detection out there to root it out.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00013=We better get to that data core fast, Jimmy. The queen-bitch over there is gettin' awful close.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00014=Sir, Kerrigan is close to finding a data core. Its vital that you destroy the core before she gets to it.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00015=Raynor's Raiders? Get us out of here!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00016=Did the doctor send you too? 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00017=The Raiders are here! We're saved! 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00018=We couldn't reach the data cores! Help us out!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00019=Marines - we are leaving!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00020=Raiders! Over here!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00021=Hey Raiders!! Come pick us up!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00022=Over here! Up on the roof!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00023=You can't leave well enough alone, can you Jim? It was stupid of you to come here.  
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00024=Hey Raynor! We saw some movement over at Rob's Guns. There might be some survivors in there.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00025=Of course! The Moebius data cores! You won't get the rest of them!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00026=Ah hell. At least she doesn't know where to find the other cores. We better get to the next one, fast!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00027=Hey man! Could use some help down here!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00028=Nice of you to drop by. I was runnin' low on ammo.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00029=Hey, good to see you. I was startin' to think I was the only survivor.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00030=Hey! Hey! OVER HERE!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00032=Time is running out, sir! You have to move now if you're going to beat Kerrigan to that data core.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00033=Sir, you better do something about that Nydus worm before our base gets overrun!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00034=She fears their power - just as she fears the Xel'Naga who created them. The Xel'Naga created both the protoss and the zerg, Commander. They were the gods of their time. 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00035=Alright, Doctor - you wanna tell me why the Queen of Blades wants these artifacts so damn bad?
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00036=Brutalisk! Stetmann wanted one of those things to research. I reckon we can oblige him.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00037=For all her strength, the Queen of Blades is nothing but an impotent child in comparison.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00038=You never could recognize a lost cause, could you Jim?
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00040=You're even more desperate than I thought. You can't really believe this 'plan' of yours has even a chance of working.
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00046=Poor, poor Jim. You can't stop me. No one can!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00047=I've seen through your 'Doctor Narud's' pathetic charade. I know what the artifacts really are! And they will be mine!
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00048=Whatever they are, Kerrigan - I sure as hell ain't lettin' you have 'em. 
Conversation/TTychus03/Line00049=That Queen of Blades really is quite a nuisance, isn't she? 
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00001=Commander Raynor! Thank the stars, you've come! 
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00002=[Angry 50]Yeah well, that was all a long time ago, Doctor. Looks like you got one heck of a zerg problem here.[/Angry] [Surprise 55]Where do you need us?[/Surprise]
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00003=We're ready to evacuate, but none of the teams I sent to purge the Foundation data cores have reported back! 
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00004=I need you to destroy those cores before the Queen of Blades finds them and discovers the coordinates of the remaining artifacts! The fate of the entire Sector could hang in the balance!
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00005=You had a sterling reputation as a Marshal many years ago and I know you'll do your best to help us.
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00006=Kerrigan... (beat)
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00007=Alright then Doc, our timetable's shorter than we thought. We gotta move! 
Conversation/TTychus03Briefing/Line00012=(alert signal is heard) Class twelve psi-pattern detected. Recommend extreme caution. 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00001=Ok the artifact's secure! Saddle up people! We're out of here!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00002=Resources have been exposed by the fire wave. They can be collected by any ground unit.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00003=This Tal'darim base is in a good spot for us. We just need to clear them out and take possession.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00004=This makes no sense! Sir, the Tal'darim aren't retreating from the fire wall!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00005=Neither fire, nor the fury of war will drive us from this hallowed site! The artifact shall remain inviolate! 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00006=The Tal'darim base has been cleared, that should buy us a little elbow room.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00007=You need to destroy that next Tal'darim base, sir! We need the room to move our own base structures forward.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00008=Good work, sir. With that base cleared we'll be able to keep ahead of the fire-wave a little longer.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00009=James Raynor! We anticipated your arrival! Now you will pay for desecrating our holy relics!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00010=Oh hell, not these Tal'darim guys again. They seriously need to learn when to quit.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00011=Our warriors' sacrifice was not in vain! We gladly march towards death to ensure your doom!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00012=Keep yer skirt on, Sparky! Jimmy'll get to it when he's good an' ready.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00013=Alert. Fire wave approaching. Base structures are at risk. Immediate relocation advised. 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00014=Don't forget to salvage any structures you can't take with you, sir! 
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00015=Warning! Fire wave arrival is imminent. Base evacuation required!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00016=The fire wave's right on top of us, sir! We need to move our base structures or they'll be destroyed!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00017=Hope you brought your sun-screen, cowboy.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00018=Now ain't the time, Swann.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00019=Relax, hotshot. I got something useful for ya'; Banshees. These babies can blow the snot outta ground forces. Got cloaking too. Gotta love that!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00020=We will pursue you to the end of the universe, James Raynor! A thousand deaths cannot atone for your wanton sacrilege!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00021=Nice job, let's get our base up and running and get that artifact!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00022=Whoa! Careful of those protoss cannons! They can detect banshees even when they're cloaked!
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00023=The Tal'darim outpost to the east would make an excellent location to move our base to - we just need to clear them out and take possession.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00024=Additional resources have been exposed on the planet's surface, Commander.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00025=The fire wave has revealed more resources, Commander.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00026=Commander. More resources have been detected in front of the fire wave.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00027=Additional resources are available in front of the fire wave.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00028=All resources currently exposed by the fire wave have been collected.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00029=No additional resources can be detected in front of the fire wave at this time.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00030=All exposed resources have been collected, Commander.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00031=Resource recovery complete. There are no resources left in front of the fire wave.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00032=Sensors indicate all exposed resources have now been collected.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00033=Sir, the planet's crust is melting in front of the fire wave. You'll be able to find extra resources at the wave's forward edge
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00034=Warning. Fire wave approaching.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00035=Resources are spread pretty thin here Sir. We've deployed a second command center to help with collection.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00036=Sir, that star is flaring up. It's going to get a lot hotter down there very soon.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00038=Sir there's another solar flare headed your way. Better pull back to a safe location.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00039=Another solar flare incoming. Get to safety.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00040=I don't have good news sir. There's another flare in the works.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00041=Sir. We're detecting solar activity -- it's another flare. Get your forces to safety if you can.
Conversation/TTychus04/Line00042=The sun is becoming unstable. Another flare is imminent. Get out of there!
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00001=There she is - planet Typhon. Don't look so bad.
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00002=Yep. Sensors indicate....
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00003=Fire. Why does it always have to be fire...
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00004=Well let's grab that artifact and get outta here before your Queen of Blades shows up lookin' for it. 
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00005=The star's energy output just jumped five hundred percent! I've never seen anything like it!
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00006=Right there - smack dab in the middle of all them protoss...
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00007=Meantime the planet's getting bombarded by waves of fire...
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00008=Our mobile structures can relocate and keep us just ahead of the fire, but we'll need to salvage everything we can't take with us.
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00009=The good news is, we've got a significant cache of supplies planetside, so we shouldn't need to build supply depots.
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00010=Well, that's something. So where's our artifact?
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00011=Slow down, Matt. What's it mean?
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00012=It means the star will go nova in a few hours. 
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00013=You ain't seriously goin' down there?
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00014=C'mon partner, we got hours 'till that sun explodes!
Conversation/TTychus04Briefing2/Line00016=Wait, what the -
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00002=We're gonna need more than a couple of battlecruisers to blast our way through.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00003=Truly the Benefactor smiles upon us this day! Now there shall be a final reckoning!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00004=En taro Tassadar, friend Raynor!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00006=The battlecruisers should be able to survive long enough to destroy the generator, but only if they concentrate their fire.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00007=Got it.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00008=The Tal'darim have imprisoned all who oppose them. Release us and we will gladly fight at your side against them.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00010=Alright boys, hit 'em with the Yamato cannon! Couple of shots from that'll flatten anything!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00011=Caution. Anomalous gravity distortion detected.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00012=Make peace with your gods, defilers! You will now answer for your crimes!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00013=Sir, the mothership is heading straight for our base! We have to pull back and defend it!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00016=If we can't defend our base, we sure as hell can't take the vault!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00017=Fools! My...spirit returns to the Xel'Naga...(expires)
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00019=There's the first rip-field Valerian talked about.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00020=We'll be lucky to find any normal resources here, but centuries of asteroid impacts have scattered mineral fragments and crystallized vespene all over the wreck.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00021=Alright, we'll scout around and see what we can pick up.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00022=My blades thirst for vengeance!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00023=Purge the Tal'darim!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00024=We will join the hunt for the Tal'darim.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00025=Our thanks, James Raynor, The Tal'darim will pay for their treachery.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00026=Truly you bring freedom to all, friend Raynor.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00028=Well, let's introduce it to our good friend Mr. Yamato cannon.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00029=Alright, we're clear. Grab that thing and set a course to rendezvous with Valerian.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00032=That protoss mothership is formidable, sir. Scans indicate it's capable of cloaking nearby friends and phasing enemies out of existence for a short time.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00033=Take your time, Commander. I'd rather do this right and get the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00034=The vault! We are very close to the artifact.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00035=What do you think sir? Quick smash and grab?
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00036=We destroyed the generator, but the rip-field is still there!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00037=I think there's a second one. We've got to disable it fast.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00039=And leave the artifact?
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00040=You will die out here in the darkness.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00041=Your vaunted armor will not protect you. Soon you will feel my hand at your throat.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00042=Defilers! You shall suffer the fate that awaits all unbelievers!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00043=Your presence is an abomination to this place! You shall feel the wrath of the chosen!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00044=We are running low on minerals at this location. Additional mineral supplies have been located nearby.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00045=It may be necessary to move operations closer to mineral supplies.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00046=How did these animals get loose?
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00047=Damn you Raynor! You've freed the cursed Dark Templar!
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00048=Commander, the mothership warped back to the vault.
Conversation/TTychus05/Line00049=The protoss mothership used a vortex on our forces. They will cease to exist for a few moments.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00001=My Moebius associates have finally tracked down the last piece of the artifact. It's on a derelict Xel'Naga ship located within the Sigma Quadrant.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00002=Anything else we should know?
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00003=Pretty far off the beaten path, junior...
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00004=The artifact is ...here. The ship has several Rip-field generators which disintegrate everything at a molecular level in a matter of moments.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00006=Well, long range scans have identified a sizeable Tal'darim force holding in the area.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00007=[Fear 50]We are in way over our heads on this one, Jimmy. Walkin' into rip-fields?[/Fear] [Angry 80]I didn't sign up for no suicide mission! We should just take the money and run.[/Angry]
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00008=Gettin' cold feet, Tychus?
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00009=[Angry 40]I lost nine years in prison on account of you.[/Angry][Angry 70] Ain't tossin' what's left of my life away just so you can rescue your little princess![/Angry] [Angry 50]Remember - you owe me, partner.[/Angry]
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00010=Fine, then. You know where I'll be.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00011=Adjutant, prep the ship for jump. (beat) Let's get this over with.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00012=Not enough to quit on somethin' like this! You're relieved. You can sit this one out... partner.
Conversation/TTychus05Briefing/Line00013=Fortunately our new Minotaur class battlecruisers should be able to survive the fields long enough to destroy the generators.
Conversation/TVNews_Utility/Line00001=UNN News!
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00007=Donny Vermillion, UNN. We've got Kate Lockwell on remote feed from Agria, a fringe colony. Are you there Kate?
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00008=Okay, we seem to be having a sound problem with -- I'm being told Emperor Mengsk is going to address us directly? Let's take you to his announcement, already in progress.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00009=While Mengsk has a lot of faith in General Warfield, I should point out that the general is an honorable man and was not associated with Mengsk when Tarsonis fell.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00010=There you have it, viewers. With Warfield in command, the zerg Swarm will be defeated in no time. Up next: Raynor ups his campaign of terror -- just as the zerg reappear. Coincidence? You decide after these messages.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00011=... My finest military minds are being brought to bear, and it's my pleasure to announce that they'll soon be led by the hero of Torus himself,  General Horace Warfield.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00012=Warfield? I thought he retired years ago.
Conversation/TVTHanson01/Line00016=With General Warfield at the helm and our finely honed Dominion military under his command, I have every confidence that this new zerg threat will be contained very soon. 
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00009=Thanks for joining us. Our own Kate Lockwell is reporting live from the refugee ship Skynyrd II, in orbit around the planet Meinhoff.
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00010=Donny, the death toll out here is soaring. Massive refugee fleets like this one are struggling to reach the safety of the core worlds. Many of them won't. They're short on food, water and hope--
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00011=Kate, we'll discuss how the Dominion will rescue those worlds when we get there!
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00012=There's a lot of talk about rescue among the refugees, but they are pinning their hopes on para-military and rebel groups such as Raynor's Rai--
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00013=Great report Kate! Live from a refugee ship over Meinhoff, where everyone eagerly awaits the Dominion's return. Up next, a Vermillion commentary: refugees, are they really our responsibility?
Conversation/TVTHanson02/Line00014=You're all heart, Donny.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00006=Welcome back. We've got good and bad news tonight from our UNN headquarters on Korhal. The influx of refugees has dropped as various fringe worlders have found new planets on which to settle. For the bad news, let's go to Kate Lockwell. Kate?
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00007=What? Is -- is the feed open? Hi! Um, yes, hi Donny. Well many of the refugees are starting new colonies and they've declared themselves independent of the Dominion.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00008=They have no faith in Emperor Mengsk's leadership.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00009=Well Donny, they mostly seem like regular folks who are scared about the current crisis -- and angry that the Dominion didn't do more to save them. Some of them have praised Jim Ray--
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00010=Branding themselves as rebels.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00011=Thanks for that, Kate. You heard it here first. Serious questions about Emperor Mengsk's leadership across the fringe worlds.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00012=Can he warn me when he's going to do that?
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00013=You heard it here first. Ungrateful rebels digging in their heels across the fringe worlds. For UNN, I'm Donny Vermillion.
Conversation/TVTHanson03A/Line00014=Funny how people take it personal when you abandon them to the zerg.
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00005=All our efforts at this time are focused on halting the zerg advance on the Core Worlds.
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00008=Your best and only source for news, this is Donny Vermillion for UNN! Refugees continue to flood Dominion Space -- they can't seem to find a safe planet anywhere, and they're showing up on our doorsteps.
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00009=Donny, Emperor Mengsk today announced that he's ordered the fleet to turn away refugee ships that enter core-world systems. Which raises the question -- will Dominion ships really fire on unarmed civilian vessels? General Warfield had this to say:
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00010=In other words, the General dodged the question. If Dominion forces fire on unarmed civilians--
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00011=Let's hope they don't. You heard it here first. For UNN, I'm Donny Vermillion.
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00012=Now Kate, we can't second guess our boys in the field, can we? You heard it here first. For UNN, I'm Donny Vermillion.
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00013=Really Donny?
Conversation/TVTHanson03B/Line00014=Ol' Mengsk is findin' that running an empire ain't all it's cracked up to be.
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00006=Everyone's a critic...
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00007=Ladies and gentlemen, each night I bring you the news in the most fair and balanced manner possible. But tonight I have a commentary.
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00008=Some have asked me what the difference is between our leader, Emperor Mengsk, and the traitor Jim Raynor. They point out that Mengsk rebelled against the government of his youth, and came to power through the use of violence and subversion. Why is it wrong for Jim Raynor to rebel in similar fashion?
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00009=There is a difference. When Emperor Mengsk began his revolution, there was no threat hanging over humanity. James Raynor is waging his revolution while we are at war with two alien races.
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00010=Donny, we're not officially at war with the Protoss--
Conversation/TVTHorner01/Line00011=James Raynor, have you no conscience? Shouldn't you fall in line, putting your petty complaints aside as we struggle for humanity's very survival against this alien menace?
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00006=Up next, Zerglings allergic to lemon juice: old wives' tale, or new super-weapon in the fight for humanity?
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00007=I've heard these conspiracy theories before. But the fact remains the zerg invaded Tarsonis en masse and no force in the universe could have stopped their onslaught. It was a very...terrible day.  
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00008=Emperor, much has been written in regards to the tragic fall of Tarsonis. Tilosky's investigative documentary 'Imperial Dawn', even claims that you brought down the Confederate system by assuring Tarsonis' fall.
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00009=Tilosky's film highlights the seeming...convenience of the aliens annihilating a corrupt government that you yourself spent a lifetime trying to overthrow.  
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00010=Millions died that day, and you speak to me of convenience? Yes, I strove against the evils of the Old Confederacy, but never with the object of personal gain! When I was called upon to take up the heavy burden of leadership I did so only to ensure our continuing survival as a species.
Conversation/TVTHorner02/Line00011=Striking words from the Emperor himself.
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00003=That's correct, Donny. We'll show the Odin on the streets of Korhal itself, with full coverage from your fine network.
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00005=It's true, Kate. The Odin was delayed in shipping, and we briefly lost communication with the production facility. But it arrived safely, so we can go ahead with the unveiling.
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00006=Your boy Horner is actually pullin' this off. Gotta say, I'm mighty impressed.
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00007=This is Kate Lockwell reporting from UNN headquarters on Korhal. Let's go to Donny Vermillion, on special assignment.
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00008=Kate, I'm very pleased to be talking to General Horace Warfield. General, I understand that Dominion Forces will soon be showing off their newest weapon, the Odin war machine?
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00009=General, Kate Lockwell here. I've heard rumblings about some sort of logistics trouble with the Odin's debut?
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00010=Now Kate!
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00011=What is wrong with that woman? Tell her not to interrupt my interviews!
Conversation/TVTHorner03/Line00012=You heard it here first. The Dominion unveiling new weapons of destruction on the streets of Korhal!
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00002=This evidence has been falsified! The enemies of the Dominion will go to any length to soil my good reputation! These ruthless, slanderous attacks cannot--
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00008=Kate Lockwell here, live from Korhal. There's rioting in the streets. Citizens are setting fire to government buildings to express their shock and anger at the startling revelations from earlier today!
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00009=I had a brother on Tarsonis. I had a brother there! Um. I... um...
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00010=Right. Thanks for that Donny. Okay, Emperor Mengsk broadcast a statement earlier today. Unfortunately, UNN's satellites were on lockdown at the time. Let's replay a bit of that:
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00011=At that point the Emperor was shouted down. He's since retreated to his palace and refuses to speak to anyone. In this reporter's opinion, Emperor Mengsk has been revealed as a --
Conversation/TVTHorner04/Line00012=Donny, what's the situation where you are?
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00006=We finally got ya, Arcturus. Nice to see the media taking shots at you for a change.
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00007=This is Kate Lockwell for UNN. Donny Vermillion remains on sick leave -- get better Donny! Coming up later, we begin a ten part exposé on corruption in the Dominion government. How high does it go?
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00009=Tonight however, I'd like to return to the topic of Tarsonis, and the day it fell. Families ripped apart -- literally -- when the savage zerg arrived. Mountains of dead bodies, deserted cities...
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00010=Let's play that clip again.
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00011=In this reporter's opinion--
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00012=I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me....
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00013=Stop! Wait! You can't just come in here --
Conversation/TVTHorner05S/Line00014=By order of Dominion Security, this newscast is terminated.
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00005=Keep talkin' pal. I'm just gettin' started.
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00006=This is Donny Vermillion, live from the UNN studios on Korhal. We've got a breaking story for you. Let's go live to our own Kate Lockwell, on the fringe world of Mar Sara. Kate?
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00007=Thanks Donny! Rebel Jim Raynor has reappeared in a big way. He's attacked a Dominion depot near Backwater Station, seizing weapons and distributing them to the local populace.
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00008=Kate, I bet the locals are pretty nervous about having a notorious outlaw in their neighborhood.
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00009=Actually Donny, the people I talked to seemed really encouraged by the--
Conversation/TVTRaynor01/Line00010=Thanks Kate! You heard it here first -- Jim Raynor, terrorizing the locals on Mar Sara. When we return, are your kids using stim-paks?
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00001=There's no telling what kind of havoc these supposedly innocuous relics might wreak upon our worlds.   
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00002=Look on the bright side, partner; you're a wanted man either way. 
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00003=Thanks, Tychus. 
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00007=Anyone found in possession of these items will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law. 
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00009=Thanks for staying with us. Let's go now to Kate Lockwell with an update on Jim Raynor's violent uprising.
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00010=Thanks Donny. Raynor's clearly widening his list of targets. He's attacked a Dominion archaeological dig, and possibly seized a dangerous alien artifact.
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00011=Emperor Mengsk spoke on this subject earlier today:
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00012=Shocking, Kate. I imagine civilian casualties were high as a result of Raynor's terrorist actions.
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00013=Actually, the only civilian deaths appear to be collateral damage from overzealous Dominion Security Forc-
Conversation/TVTRaynor02/Line00014=Thanks Kate! You heard it here first -- Jim Raynor, killing women and children on Mar Sara.
Conversation/TVTTosh01/Line00005=Well Kate, I'm not allowed to say much, but I can tell you <Censored> and his allies will not <Censored>. We expect to <Censored> them very soon.
Conversation/TVTTosh01/Line00006=Donny Vermillion, UNN. Your first, last and only stop for the truth. Tonight our own Kate Lockwell uncovers a secret shadow war, waged by our brave Dominion ghosts, against a ruthless, hidden enemy.
Conversation/TVTTosh01/Line00007=Thanks Donny. I'm talking live with <Censored>, a specialist in the Dominion <Censored>.  <Censored>, I understand that you and your comrades have been <Censored> against a <Censored> <Censored> of <Censored>. What can you tell us about that? 
Conversation/TVTTosh01/Line00008=I think we'll all sleep a little better tonight, knowing our Dominion forces are watching over us. For UNN, I'm Donny Vermillion.
Conversation/TVTTosh02/Line00006=... I repeat, death toll is in the thousands. A Dominion weapons plant exploded hours ago, causing a chain reaction that has taken out several housing complexes in this working-class neighborhood.
Conversation/TVTTosh02/Line00007=Dominion Security Forces claim it was an act of terror by the notorious Jim Raynor. But our own investigations suggest that the plant must have been infiltrated by forces with sophisticated stealth technologies.
Conversation/TVTTosh02/Line00008=It begs the question: could some of the Dominion's Ghost operatives have gone rogue?
Conversation/TVTTosh02/Line00009=For UNN, this is Kate Lockwell reporting from core world, Nephor II.
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00006=More dangerous for the real bad guys, Donny. You should be worried...
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00007=Breaking news. Reports coming in today suggest -- what's that? We're going to Kate? But I --
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00008=The Dominion's highest-value prisoners are loose tonight after a daring raid broke open New Folsom prison. Dominion Security Forces are on high-alert, as some of the prisoners were former members of Project: Shadowblade, which we've discovered to be a subversive off-shoot of the Dominion's Ghost program. A number of political dissidents were also freed during the attack.
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00009=Do we know who did this Kate? Was it Raynor's Raiders?
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00010=The evidence we have suggests it was, Donny.
Conversation/TVTTosh03A/Line00011=There you have it, Jim Raynor making our world just a little more dangerous tonight. From the UNN studios on Korhal, I'm Donny Vermillion.
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00006=This is Kate Lockwell, live for UNN. Dominion Security Forces are telling us tonight that their agents have hunted down and executed the leaders of a subversive rebel group calling itself Project: Shadowblade.
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00007=Great news, Kate. Did they say how they feel about this?
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00008=Um, no, Donny, they didn't, but I imagine they're quite happy?
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00009=There you have it, Dominion Security, destroying the shadowy espionage arm of Jim Raynor's terrorist organization.
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00010=Wait, what? Dominion Security didn't say anything about Rayno-
Conversation/TVTTosh03B/Line00011=Let's go to Commercial.
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00005=This is Donny Vermillion, live from UNN. Tonight we're going to discuss the infamous Queen of Blades. Scientists and military insiders have long speculated that the enigmatic alien is, in fact, an infested human.
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00006=That's right Donny. Is it possible that the leader of the zerg has a human heart?
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00007=More importantly, Kate --could this mean some kind of terran-zerg alliance is possible?
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00008=Donny, there's never been any evidence -- at all -- to suggest that infested humans retain their free will.
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00009=You make a good point, Kate. The question is then, how do we kill her?
Conversation/TVTTychus01/Line00010=That's one I think we all can agree on. If humanity is to survive, the Queen of Blades needs to be eliminated.
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00014=This is Donny Vermillion, live from UNN. Tonight, the zerg invasion: the Battle So Far.
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00015=Donny has there been any word on when we start pushing the aliens back?
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00016=The Terran Dominion is holding firm under zerg aggression. Our industrial complex has stepped up production on all fronts, enlistment rates have risen within the penal system, and the Marine Corps is ready to get in the fight. The zerg won't know what hit them!
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00017=Kate, if I revealed that, I'd be giving away vital Dominion secrets.
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00018=You think the zerg watch our broadcast?
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00019=(to camera)I know they do Kate. I know they do.
Conversation/TVTTychus02/Line00020=Well, you heard it here first, folks. This is Kate Lockwell for UNN.
Conversation/TVTTychus03/Line00006=Kate Lockwell for UNN. The elusive Queen of Blades was spotted on Tyrador recently. Dr. Emil Narud head of the renowned Moebius Foundation, had a run-in with the alien queen, but is currently unavailable for comment.
Conversation/TVTTychus03/Line00007=In a statement, Dr. Narud credited Raynor's Raiders with keeping the Queen of Blades from achieving her --
Conversation/TVTTychus03/Line00008=Kate, I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have a breaking story... apparently... um, go to -- go to -- commercial. Please. Commercial.
Conversation/TVTTychus04/Line00008=That's some damn fine reportin'.
Conversation/TVTTychus04/Line00009=This is Kate Lockwell for UNN. Tonight, top Dominion military analysts are still confused -- and relieved -- to report that while attacks do continue throughout the fringe, the main zerg push into Dominion space seems to have slowed.
Conversation/TVTTychus04/Line00010=That's wonderful news Kate. Our boys have really taken the fight to the zerg!
Conversation/TVTTychus04/Line00011=Of course, Donny. But there's also a sense that whatever the zerg were after... they either got it, or they've given up on it. We may never know.
Conversation/TVTTychus04/Line00012=You heard it here first.
Conversation/TVTTychus05/Line00007=Oh, Junior's doin' just fine. So far.
Conversation/TVTTychus05/Line00008=This is Donny Vermillion, live from UNN studios on Korhal. Troubling news tonight, as crown Prince Valerian seems to have gone missing.
Conversation/TVTTychus05/Line00009=That's right Donny. Prince Valerian was scheduled to speak at the launch of the Dominion's newest Battlecruiser, the White Star. But the ceremony had to proceed without the prince when he failed to arrive.
Conversation/TVTTychus05/Line00010=Official government sources offered no comment.
Conversation/TVTTychus05/Line00011=Whatever the situation, we here at UNN hope the prince is okay.
Conversation/TVTValerian01/Line00001=I know what it means. And it ain't good.
Conversation/TVTValerian01/Line00002=This is Kate Lockwell reporting live for UNN. Stunning news tonight as massive numbers of zerg began pulling back to their main hive on the planet Char. While they aren't giving up the worlds they've conquered, most of the aliens appear to be massing near the fiery planet.
Conversation/TVTValerian01/Line00003=What can it mean Kate?
Conversation/TVTValerian01/Line00004=We really don't know, Donny. We'll keep you posted with any further developments.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00001=Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a sad day for us here at UNN. I regret to inform you that last night Donny Vermillion had himself committed to the Dominion Mental Health Center here on Korhal.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00002=While the nature of his abrupt mental breakdown remains unknown, we do know that he was clad only in his socks and rumored to be in possession of Emperor Mengsk's manifesto and a pound of peanut butter.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00003=We wish you all the best, Donny, and hope for your speedy recovery. In the meantime, I'll be taking over as chief anchor here at UNN. For UNN, I'm Kate Lockwell.
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00004=I hope that pompous ass rots in his -- oh wait, is this thing on?
Conversation/TVTValerian02Aor02B/Line00005=Woo! Yes! Woo!
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00001=Today I'm speaking with Crown Prince Valerian. Highness, what do you say about the allegations that recently came to light regarding your father's corruption--
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00002=Kate, there's no need to belabor that topic. Highness, I think the question on everyone's mind is: do you have a special lady in your life?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00003=I... ah, what?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00004=We have a very special guest today... crown prince Valerian! Thank you so much for joining us, Highness!
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00005=Thank you Kate, it's wonderful to be here.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00006=Let me get right to the question on everyone's mind -- is there anyone special in your life right now?
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00007=Truth be told, Kate, I have had a crush on you for many years.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00008=Oh stop!
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00009=But in all seriousness, with the zerg invasion, there's little time for such things. I've been studying military tactics under General Warfield, and whatever spare time I have is devoted to statecraft.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00010=It's my goal to be the best emperor our people could ask for.  When the time comes, of course.
Conversation/TVTZeratul01/Line00011=Wonderful, now I've got two of 'em to worry about.
Conversation/TVTZeratul03/Line00001=Ol' Mengsk is in deep now. He can burn for all I care.
Conversation/TVTZeratul03/Line00002=Tonight on UNN -- Another world has broken into open revolt, and Emperor Mengsk still refuses to give any interviews. Is the Dominion falling apart around us?
Conversation/TVTZeratul03/Line00003=In this reporter's opinion--
Conversation/TVTZeratul03/Line00004=I will rule this sector or see it burnt to ashes around me....
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00001=I'm assuming command, here! You men fall in with us and we'll see to finding your General! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00002=Yes, sir! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00003=I so love the way you kindle their hope, Jim. By all means - bring them all to my doorstep. It'll be like lambs to the slaughter. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00004=(to the men) Don't listen to her! Stay focused and we'll make it out of here together!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00006=We're on our way General! Just hold on...Damn, he can't even hear us.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00007=(ghostly laughter)
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00008=We've reached the crash-site! With any luck, old Warfield's still alive and kickin'! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00009=Warfield won't be alive for very much longer. My pets will be drawn to his fear and that of his men. There's absolutely nothing you can do.  
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00010=Matt, keep me updated on those drop pods as they get to Char.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00011=If we can reach enough of them before the zerg, we might just have a chance of fighting our way through this.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00012=You're sure talkin' a lot, Kerrigan. Maybe the fear you smell is your own. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00013=(laughing) Some invasion. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00014=Yeah, well bring 'em all on, darlin'! There's more where that came from!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00015=Sir, I'm tracking an incoming drop pod. It should be landing close to your position any second.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00020=... is Gen... Warfield. To any Dominion ship in... range, my ship is down ...nd we've sustained heavy losses. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00021=We're holding position but we need support ...soon. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00022=Raynor's Raiders! We sure are glad to see you boys! But where's General Warfield? 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00026=Alright, let's get out there and find 'em before the zerg do!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00027=Sir, I've detected a drop pod in your vicinity.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00028=You were fools to come here!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00031=Sending coordinates to a nearby drop pod.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00032=Sir, another drop pod is coming down near your location.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00034=How many men have you led to their deaths here, Jim?
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00036=You've got another drop pod landing near by.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00037=Sir, another drop pod has arrived near your perimeter.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00038=We can salvage some of the wreckage from the Dominion base for resources. If we find more, we can put it to good use. 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00039=At least a barracks made it down in one piece! Fly it somewhere safe behind our lines and start producing!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00040=Commander. Tactical analysis indicates the zerg greatly outmatch your current forces.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00042=Get this factory back to the landing zone and get it building! 
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00043=Some air power is just what we need! Secure this starport and bring it behind our guns.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00044=Sir, I read multiple drop pods entering the atmosphere. I don't think you'll have enough time to rescue them all, not with this much zerg in the area.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00045=Dammit! We'll rescue as many as we can. But I don't think everyone's gonna live through this.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00046=There's another wave of drop pods coming in, sir. It would be too dangerous to try and rescue them all.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00047=Commander, the last of the Dominion drop pods have reached the surface of Char.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00049=We should mobilize everything we've got and try to break through to Warfield.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00050=Looks like we're on our own, boys.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00051=Our supplies and troops are being shot down by the planetary defenses. Anyone on the surface, try to take down those defenses!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00052=That's one down. How many of these planetary defenses are there?
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00053=I guess we'll find out.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00054=Whoever is taking out those defenses down there, you have my gratitude.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00055=That should about do it!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00056=Mayday! Mayday! This is General Warfield. My ship is taking terrible... terrible damage!
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00057=The only way we're gettin'  to Warfield is straight through those Nydus worms.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00058=The zerg planetary defenses are made up of Spore Cannons. They destroy targets entering the planet's orbit.
Conversation/TValerian01/Line00060=Commander, Valerian is sending cargo pods to the surface.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00001=Dammit! I told 'em a frontal assault wasn't goin' to work! She was playing with us the whole time! 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00002=Well, brother - we're alive at least. Looks like the few battle-groups that did make it to the surface are scattered all over the place.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00004=Do you think death is the worst thing that can happen to you here?
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00005=Soon all will serve the swarm!
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00006=She's tryin' to get in our heads, man. We gotta keep it together! 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00007=If we're gonna pull this caper off, we need to rally as many survivors as we can. 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00008=Commander, Dominion battle-groups are still landing all around you but they're in pretty bad shape and coming under heavy attack from the zerg.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00009=Alright, let's get out there and rescue their sorry butts!  We need to pull together a real fighting force - or we won't have a prayer of stopping Kerrigan! 
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00010=Infestation is what's coming for you.
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00012=On the right on the right! They're coming around! (static)
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00013=Teams bravo, echo and delta have gone dark. Repeat, alpha has lost contact with all elements -- (explosion. Static)
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00014=Where's command? I got no support, I got zerg comin' outta my-- (static)
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00015=We're on fire. Repeat, we've lost all thruster power-- (static)
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00016=They're coming outta the ground -- (static)
Conversation/TValerian01Briefing/Line00017=Any station this net, any station this net, we need fire support, we need it now -- Ahh! (static)
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00001=Let's introduce these boys to a little terran ingenuity - the mark 12 penetrator round.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00002=Fire in yer hole!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00003=The motion detector's off the scale! Swann, what say you get that turret of yours set up before we advance?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00004=No sooner said than done, cowboy. Just stay behind 'ol Flamin' Betty here and let her take the heat.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00005=Hell, earthquake!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00006=That's no 'quake - it's Ultralisks!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00007=Watch our six! More of 'em comin'! 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00008=(badly distorted) Raynor? Can you hear me? 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00009=I read you, General. Go ahead.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00010=(badly distorted) Some of my men are nearby. They're pinned down. Help 'em out an' they'll join you.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00011=Raynor? Hot damn they sent the big guns for us!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00012=We got a hundred tons of zerg incoming!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00013=Hey, freak! Catch!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00014=Y-you gotta take out those worms! I can't keep patching us up forever!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00015=We gotta defend the charge until it's armed. Watch all points, boys.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00016=Y'know one of them choke-points'll make a great spot for Flamin' Betty. Where do you want her, hotshot?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00017=Oh guys? I'm out of supplies, I'll go back to the ship for more. No? Oh...Oh ok then.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00018=Oh-oh lordy...this must be where they take their prisoners....
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00019=(grim) ...And infest 'em. There's no helping these guys. We gotta put 'em outta their misery.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00020=Damn you freaks are ugly! Lets waste 'em!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00021=...Joiinnn ussss
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00022=You're too late!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00023=We need a good spot to hole up or we're gonna be zerg chow!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00024=Watch it! Banelings! Don't let 'em get close!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00025=Those things are pretty nasty. Next time, you should try not to let them splash you!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00026=Ambush! They're behind us!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00027=(badly distorted) Come in, Raynor? I'm detecting survivors of another squad close by. Find 'em and rescue 'em.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00028=I'm gonna guess that last part was 'rescue 'em'.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00029=Hell and I thought we wuz gonna play poker with 'em.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00030=Great to see you guys. The cavern ahead is full of worms so we better be careful.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00031=Huh. Was that it? 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00032=They're only gettin' started! Move up by twos! We gotta blast 'em back!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00033=Go! Go! We gotta keep moving or they'll crush us!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00034=Push forward and kill the worms! We can't get stuck here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00035=Same deal as before! Set up a perimeter and don't let anything reach the charge while it's arming.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00036=We got company, Jimmy?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00037=No...I'm picking up something ...but it's stationary. Eggs or larva maybe?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00038=(badly distorted) Raynor, another squad is up ahead. Their situation sounds dire. Proceed with extreme caution.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00039=Oh god! Game over, man! Game over!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00040=We gotta take her down! No way we can leave the charge while she's around! 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00041=Get that charge deployed! I've got a bad feeling about this place.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00042=Damn! She's popping eggs!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00043=She's goin' for more eggs! Stop the Queen before she gets to them!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00044=Um ah, guys? I'm reading some weird biometrics...like-like she's... evolving or something!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00045=Ah hell, the lava's rising!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00046=That was the whole idea, Tychus! Now run for the extraction point, you idiot!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00047=Let's get out of here! Double time! Gogogo! 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00048=Right between the eyes!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00049=Say goodnight, ugly.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00050=You won't feel a thing.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00051=Lights out!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00052=This is it. Swann, I've marked the fault line with a flare, plant one of those charges near it.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00053=The charges are ready to blow, get the hell out of here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00054=Good job. That's the first charge, when we get all three, the chamber will flood with lava.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00055=Quit hoggin' all the fun, Jimmy. Lemme try out these shredder grenades...
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00056=Betty here'll roast 'em good.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00057=How'd you like them apples, huh?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00058=Extra crispy!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00059=Smells like....victory!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00060=Say hello to my little friend!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00061=Who's your daddy?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00062=Time to kick ass!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00063=I'm all outta bubble gum!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00064=Over here! Help us!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00065=Just one more charge and we're gonna have ourselves a Nydus barbeque. Stay sharp, boys.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00066=Y'know, the way those eggs all hatched...It's like they were waiting for us.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00067=There's a strong likelihood that another zerg creature was controlling them.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00068=Gah. Whatever's poppin' those eggs is gonna be in a world o' hurt when I get a hold of 'em!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00069=Thanks, man. I thought we were goners.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00070=All set, cowboy. When this thing goes off we need to be a long way from here.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00071=Least there's plenty of open space, clear fields of ---
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00072=What the hell is that?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00073=No life signs... She's dead, Jim!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00074=Us too if we don't get the hell out of here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00075=The charges are countin' down, hotshot, damn straight we gotta go! Here, Betty'll keep 'em busy!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00076=Big or small don't matter none. Just kill zerg wherever, whenever you can.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00077=Whoa, did you see the size of that mother? 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00078=Sure are some ugly suckers down here. 
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00079=Yes -- well. What can I say?
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00080=Let's get the hell outta here!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00081=You got it, cowboy.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00082=Ah worms. Right.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00083=Thanks for the advice, son. Now shut up.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00084=Zerg are so fascinating. I wish we knew more about their physiology.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00085=I know all about 'em. Put a bullet in 'em, they die.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00086=Well, that's not exactly --
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00087=Shut it you two.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00088=Jimmy, you need stuff fixed, I'm your guy. This crawlin' around in caves... that guy I ain't.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00089=Swann, if I didn't know better, I'd say you're scared!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00090=Yellow. I knew it.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00091=It ain't that. Just... weapons, tools, they make sense to me. Caves and zerg, just ain't my cup of tea.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00092=Well. I'm scared.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00093=They're destroying the seismic charges. We gotta stop 'em!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00094=Take it easy sparky.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00095=Light 'em up.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00096=Ahhh!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00097=You ain't safe yet.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00098=Watch it! Infestor pods!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00099=Hot damn! Nothing like a good ol' fashioned knock-down-drag-out brawl!
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00100=Look at all those caves crumble. Ain't sorry to see 'em go.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00101=Wow. We sure killed a lot of them. I bet they're really scared of us now. Of you.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00102=Alright, let's see how the boys held up while we were gone.
Conversation/TValerian02A/Line00103=Alright let's keep this quick and easy. Move out boys.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00001=Deep scan analysis has detected three fault lines converging beneath this area. Detonation of seismic charges in all three locations will redirect lava into the adjacent caverns. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00002=Any intel on what we'll be facing down there?
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00003=Negative, Commander. The intervening rock layers prevent accurate detection of zerg bio-signatures. Caution is advised.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00004=We're gonna need some more boys to carry the charges, if nothing else.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00005=I've been in these tunnels before. The more guys we take, the riskier it gets. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00006=I might have just the men for you. Some of my best; all decorated combat veterans with lousy discipline records. You'll love 'em.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00007=Sounds good, General, but I got my own crew for this. 'Sides, does 'em good to get outside once in a while.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00008=Alright, you do that - but I can't guarantee anything. This ain't no rescue mission. 
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00009=Some squads took cover in the tunnels during the landing so you might be able to find some reinforcements down there. I'll contact you if I detect their transponders.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00010=Alright then. Waitin' around ain't gonna make this any easier. Let's get to work.
Conversation/TValerian02ABriefing/Line00011=I'd rather bring a smaller, more experienced crew down there than a whole regiment.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00001=Good work, the first coolant tower is destroyed. Remember - once we destroy the other tower on this platform we'll only have seconds to get clear!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00002=The platform's going critical! Evacuate it now! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00003=Damn Jimmy, this whole place is ...writhing!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00004=Once we blow those coolant towers it won't matter, the platforms'll burn up and kill everything on them.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00005=Ok, that's one tower down. 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00006=Commander, you should stay away from those tunnel entrances. According to the sensors they're chock full of Mutalisks.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00007=There are a lot of ground defenses on that platform, sir.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00008=I'm picking up signs of heavy air defences on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00009=It is possible to go around to the far side and flank the defenses on this platform sir. It'll give you a cleaner shot at the towers.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00010=The reactor's melting down! Move out! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00011=Evacuate the platform! Move it!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00012=I can't detect a land route to the next platform. Youll need an air force to take out the towers on this one.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00013=There she goes! Get clear!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00014=Last section. Once we knock down the towers here we're done.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00015=Great job, Raynor!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00016=Look at that thing.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00017=Unidentified zerg organism has arrived.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00018=Yeah....so any second now....any second...There it goes!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00019=Get out of there, sir!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00020=Move it, Raiders! Off the platform!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00021=You better move out - fast!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00022=It's getting ready to blow!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00023=Look at that thing.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00024=Raynor if you can take that thing down, we won't have to face it on the surface.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00025=That giant flier is patrolling the platform. Be careful.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00026=One more section to go! Then you're done!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00027=Sir, I'm scanning to get a positive fix on all the towers.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00028=Got it. I'll mark the tower coordinates on your map.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00029=Sir, we better finish off those towers before that giant zerg gets here.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00030=Good job on taking out those towers!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00031=The first waves of zerg are incoming. We can't extract you until they're gone.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00032=What!? You mean we're stuck on this thing? 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00033=Did ya think they were just gonna let us take off? Shut up and get ready to kill some damn zerg! 
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00034=The only way to stop zerg from coming out of those tunnels is to destroy the platforms!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00035=Warning. Unidentified zerg organism detected inbound. Largest on record.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00036=Damn, that's all we need! We better take that thing down or it's gonna cause some havoc!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00037=Look at her burn.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00038=I just hope it'll give us the edge we need. Kerrigan ain't goin' down without a fight...
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00039=Even for Char, this place is crawling with hostiles. Good luck, Raynor.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00040=Sensors show those vents are full of zerg fliers. Be careful.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00041=The only way to stop the zerg from coming out of those vents is to destroy the platforms
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00042=Scans show heavy air defenses on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00043=Scans are showing tough ground defenses on that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00044=Tower's down! Now get away from it -- fast!
Conversation/TValerian02B/Line00045=Last section -- knock down this tower and we're done.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00001=The zerg fliers are using this old orbital platform as their base of operations. 
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00002=The nests are too deep inside to destroy with a bombardment, but clearing the whole thing with ground forces will be costly .
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00003=Adjutant, what's keeping that thing in orbit? Has it got power?
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00004=Affirmative. Thermal readings indicate intense heat coming from the platforms.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00005=Perfect. There's your answer, general. We get onboard and destroy the coolant towers on each section. 
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00006=Excellent plan. You missed your calling, Raynor, you would have made an outstanding staff officer.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00007=I reckon I'm right where I'm meant to be, general. Now let's get saddled up and hit that platform.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00008=It's actually made up of several smaller platforms tethered together in geostationary orbit.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00009=The reactors'll go critical and take care of the zerg for us.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00010=Kerrigan won't be givin' us a second chance.
Conversation/TValerian02BBriefing/Line00011=Core temperatures are kept stable by a series of coolant towers, still operational despite the zerg infestation.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00001=Alert! Class 12 psionic waveform detected. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00002=This has gone on long enough. Time to die. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00003=The artifact's energy nova is fully recharged.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00004=The artifact's weakening her! Fire! Fire now! Everything you've got!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00005=The pain! Damn that cursed thing! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00006=Heads up, sir! I'm detecting a large group of zerg flyers heading straight for the artifact!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00007=That did it! Stay sharp boys, it won't be long before she's back for round two! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00008=Class 12 psionic waveform detected. The Queen of Blades has returned. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00009=The Queen of Blades is inbound. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00010=Warning! The Queen of Blades has commenced her attack. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00011=The Queen of Blades has been detected! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00012=Pathetic. Is this the best you've got?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00013=You fools should never have come here! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00014=I'll scour you all from my world! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00015=Humanity has seen its last days! I promise you that! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00016=I'll take my sweet time with these! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00017=You dare! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00020=We've driven her back! Keep it up!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00025=Kerrigan's gone underground! Pour it on, troops! 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00028=She's retreated again! Hold the line!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00032=She's on the run, man. Let's keep the pressure on!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00033=You will pay for this treachery!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00034=Don't give up!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00037=More zerg flyers inbound! They're coming in behind you, watch out!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00038=Warning. Seismic disturbance detected near the command center, Nydus worm inbound.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00039=Warning. Seismic disturbance detected. Nydus worm inbound.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00040=Sir, I'm picking up a mass of Overlords heading your way. Ready your air defenses!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00041=The artifact's energy is peaking! Just hold out a little longer!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00042=Commander, the zerg will try to overrun us soon. You should build bunkers and train more units as soon as possible. 
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00043=If things get out of hand use the energy nova to clear out your base. The recharge time is pretty fast so don't hesitate to use it.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00044=Lots of zerg flyers on their way to you, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00045=I told you there'd be no more free passes, Jim. Let this be a lesson to anyone who would defy me.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00046=You've brought me the Xel'Naga artifact - It was good of you to save me the trouble of finding it for myself.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00047=Sir we're tracking a large number of zerg flyers, coming your way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00048=I'm tired of working through others. It's time I took a personal hand in your demise.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00049=An impressive defense - but not nearly impressive enough.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00050=Ready for another round, lover? Here I come ready or not.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00051=Looks like I underestimated you. You always were a clever one.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00052=Is this your idea of bravery, Jim? Or is it just desperation?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00053=My forces are without number, and yours are dwindling by the minute. This can only end one way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00054=You fools. You're playing with forces beyond your comprehension!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00055=This is not... the end.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00056=Don't get in my way.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00057=You want to play, little boy?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00058=You'll regret that.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00059=Do you know who I am?
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00060=A pathetic attempt to distract me.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00061=You should really go and check on your base.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00062=(sighs) So predictable.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00063=Artifact power at full capacity.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00064=It's now or never, General! HIT IT!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00065=Another wave of zerg flyers, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00066=Warning. Class 10 zerg flier detected.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00067=Holy... Sir, scanners show the largest zerg bio-signature I've ever seen! And it's headed your way!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00068=Warning. Large zerg force incoming.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00069=We're not ready for this many. We'll have to use the artifact.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00070=Zerg everywhere! Sir, we should activate the artifact's nova!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00071=You're being overrun! Use the artifact, go nova!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00072=Might be a good time to use the artifact's nova, Sir!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00074=She's losin' it!
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00075=I hear Sarah...
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00077=The artifact is going to have to cool down before we can use it again. It shouldn't take long.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00078=Transferring control of the artifact to you sir.
Conversation/TValerian03/Line00079=We need to down those Nydus worms or this is going to get ugly.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00001=The engineer corps is moving the Xel'Naga artifact to the base of the primary hive cluster. We'll entrench the last of our defenses all around it. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00002=Unfortunately, it's going to take some time to charge up the device for a strike against the Queen of Blades.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00003=You can bet the zerg'll be all over it the second we turn it on. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00004=You're more right than you realize
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00005=Intel provided by the Moebius Foundation suggests that the zerg will be attracted by the artifact's pulse-emanations. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00006=Once it's activated, all nearby zerg will go into a frenzy trying to reach it. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00007=There's no way we can beat a sustained zerg attack with what we've got left. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00008=Recharge or no I'll take all the help we can get right now, General.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00009=You'll have to activate the energy nova manually. Fortunately, it pulses on a sub-sonic frequency, so we'll be immune to its effects.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00010=Remember - Kerrigan's still out there waiting for us. 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00011=How could we forget? 
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00012=The artifact itself may help with that. According to intel it can discharge what they're calling an 'energy nova' that should kill any zerg within its radius.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00013=It takes time to recharge after each use, otherwise this'd be easy.
Conversation/TValerian03Briefing/Line00014=(impressed) Whoa!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00003=The foreboding prophecy weighs heavily on my heart. I'd best reach the remaining shrines before she reconsiders letting me live.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00008=Spore crawlers can detect my presence! A few well-placed void spheres will dispatch them easily enough! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00011=(telepathic - in his head) Why not surrender yourself to oblivion, Zeratul? Wouldn't it be better to end your struggle now than witness the final agonizing moments of your species?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00012=These nydus worms must be destroyed or the zerg reinforcements will overwhelm us!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00013=You might peel away the prophecy's layers, Zeratul - but you cannot outrun the doom that awaits us all!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00015=Spine crawlers! Kill them before they can take root and attack!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00023=Careful now. Kerrigan has set guards to bar our way. It could be a trap.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00027=The second fragment of the prophecy! My task is nearly complete.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00028=So much for Kerrigan's reprieve!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00029=Permit us to destroy their defenses before we proceed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00030=That spore crawler can detect me from across the chasm. It must be destroyed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00031=The Queen of Blades built hatcheries here! She seeks to subvert this sacred world. (Beat) I shall put an end to that plan.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00033=This chasm is vast. It is fortunate that I can phase through the shadows to the other side!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00034=If you can so easily read my mind, Kerrigan - you'll see that I'll never give up so long as hope remains! 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00035=Your hope is an illusion, old fool. 
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00036=The rest is obscured... what??
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00040=This hatchery must be destroyed if I am to keep the Queen of Blades from subverting this land.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00041=We cannot prevail against so many!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00042=The Queen of Blades seeks to pervert this world with that hatchery. I must destroy it!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00043=It is done. All of Kerrigan's hatcheries are destroyed. There is yet hope for this world.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00044=I must get to the Void Seeker and preserve the prophecy. I will not let my brothers' sacrifice be in vain.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00045=The prophecy must be saved. I will take it to the Void Seeker and leave this world.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00046=The prophecy was divided into fragments, each kept at separate shrines. I must gather them and depart this world quickly.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00047=The first fragment of the prophecy! Soon all will be made clear.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00048=The final piece of the prophecy. It speaks of one who shall "...break the cycle of the gods..."
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00049=For Shakuras!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00050=Greetings, exalted one. We are here in the service of High Templar Karass. He is nearby.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00051=Your presence is most welcome. Let us keep moving.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00052=Protoss... here? Quickly brothers, let us aid them!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00053=En Taro Tassadar, Prelate Zeratul! I am High Templar Karass.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00054=Kerrigan and I were both drawn here to uncover an ancient prophecy. With your aid, I pray we can discover it before her.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00055=It is an honor, great one! Lead on.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00056=Most ominous. But if the Queen of Blades seeks this prophecy, we must keep it from her.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00057=I will stand against the Queen of Blades while you escape with the fragments!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00058=I will not abandon you!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00059=The prophecy is more important than either of us! Reveal its secrets, Zeratul! The future rests on it!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00060=Your sacrifice will not be forgotten, Brother.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00062=Now... I shall become one... with the khala.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00063=I must get to the Void Seeker before the zerg overwhelm me and the prophecy is lost!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00064=I cannot decipher the fragments on my own. Yet I know who might interpret them: the Preservers of Zhakul.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00065=If they cannot... I fear this entire universe will burn.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00066=My force tracked the Queen of Blades to this world -- yet we know not what she seeks.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00067=High Templar Karass is nearby.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00068=That overseer can see through my cloak. I'd best stun it with my void prison before crossing this chasm.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00069=Spore crawlers can detect my presence! I should stun them with my void prison.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00070=That patrol of brood lords must be dealt with cautiously or we will be torn asunder.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00071=Prepare for an aerial attack. Brace yourselves my brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00072=The banelings spew acid when they die. Stalkers, take them out from a distance!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00073=We should take them out carefully, one at a time, or risk being overwhelmed.
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00074=I've placed the ultralisk in a void prison. Bring it down, Karass!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00075=Zeratul! Can you destroy the airborne zerg?
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00076=Stalkers! Take the high ground and support our brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul01/Line00077=Zeratul has destroyed their worms -- press on!
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00001=Zeratul... what the hell have you gotten yourself into?
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00002=Friend Raynor... long has it been since we stood together against the Swarm.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00003=My sojourn led me to a remote world known as Ulaan...
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00004=...where I discovered fragments of the prophecy. Yet I was not the first to find them.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00007=Since then I have wandered the Void in solitude - seeking an ancient prophecy rumored to foretell the return of the Xel'Naga.
Conversation/TZeratul01Briefing/Line00009=It falls to you now, old friend... to relive my memories... and believe.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00001=It is strangely silent here, yet these structures are intact. With power they would be functional.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00004=The Preservers you seek serve a higher power now, dark one.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00006=There are many abandoned structures in this place that we can make use of. They merely need their power restored by the construction of a few well-placed pylons.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00007=Higher power? What could have corrupted these protoss so? Truly, something foul has taken hold of this sacred place.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00008=The mighty spirits of the preservers are imprisoned close by - we must find them.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00009=The spirits of the Preservers are entombed within! We must break them open immediately!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00012=Ready yourself, noble warrior. We confront a terrible evil this day.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00014=INTRUDERS...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00015=Your lives are FORFEIT. Surrender to DESPAIR.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00016=This knowledge is FORBIDDEN.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00017=I come for you NOW. Prepare for DEATH.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00018=Some SECRETS must remain HIDDEN.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00019=OBLIVION comes. NONE shall stand.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00020=Merely a temporary setback.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00021=I shall return.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00022=Your doom is only delayed.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00023=CEASE your foolish struggle. There is no HOPE.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00024=You cannot destroy me. I shall rise again.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00025=I go to gather my strength.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00026=Enjoy your fleeting victory. This is not over.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00027=A Dark Shrine! Once power is restored it could be of great value to us.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00029=A Robotics Facility! This structure may prove useful to us.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00031=My thanks, mighty one.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00032=Your existence ENDS this day.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00034=The hybrid is draining the preservers to survive! I must free them before it is too late!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00037=A... protoss and zerg hybrid... Gods, an abomination! Who created this atrocity?
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00039=We have seen the prophetic fragments in your mind, Zeratul. We will make of them what we can.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00040=The Cycle shall draw to its end. The Xel'Naga who forged the stars will transcend their creation...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00041=Yet, the Fallen One shall remain...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00042=Destined to cover the Void in shadow...
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00043=It begins with the Great Hungerer.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00044=A Great Hungerer... could it refer to the zerg Overmind? It has a part to play in this prophecy?
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00045=Zeratul! Truly fate has sent you here.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00046=Join me, brothers, and we shall cleanse this place of evil.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00047=Command us!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00052=Greetings, brother. We come seeking the Preservers.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00054=This templar archive lies abandoned!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00055=Come, my SLAVES. The time has come to give me your STRENGTH.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00056=SACRIFICE yourselves to me, and live FOREVER.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00057=It keeps the preservers in bondage, feeding off their power! If we are to transcribe the prophecy, they must be freed!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00058=En Taro Tassadar. Do not forget, more information on managing a protoss base and army can be found in the tutorial section.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00061=Our liberation is at hand!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00062=It ends... in utter darkness.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00063=I must seek out the Overmind's final resting place. Our ancient homeworld... of Aiur.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00064=The Hybrid grows stronger! We must destroy the preserver prisons before it is too late!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00065=We must free the Preservers before we can destroy the Hybrid!
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00066=Warp in additional photon cannons for base defense.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00067=Warp in additional Gateways to allow greater combat unit production.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00068=Warp in an Assimilator to harvest vespene gas.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00069=We have recovered all of the abandoned structures on this world.
Conversation/TZeratul02/Line00070=I return to serve.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00001=Alright Zeratul, old buddy -- you got your mysterious prophecy. Now let's see what your Preservers made of it.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00002=My quest to decipher the prophecy took me to the forbidden archive world of Zhakul.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00003=Only they could transcribe the prophetic fragments. I needed to seek them out quickly.
Conversation/TZeratul02Briefing/Line00004=Here, three immortal Preservers guarded ancient knowledge.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00001=The zerg will keep coming until we are dead. I must find the Overmind's cortex and discover what I can from it.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00004=These warp gates appear to be functional. Perhaps there's a chance...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00005=Adun Toridas, Zeratul! We were trapped within the gate's energy matrix when it was deactivated! You have our thanks!  
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00006=The zerg perceive a threat to their dead master!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00007=Ah! I've heard tales of the mighty colossi sealed away beneath Aiur! The beacon must have awoken these fearsome guardians!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00034=The zerg are coming!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00035=The zerg seek to overwhelm our base!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00036=The zerg are massing near our base!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00037=If we use our Observers wisely, we can scout the area before putting ourselves at risk.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00038=The zerg seek to overwhelm us! To arms, my brethren!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00039=The colossi are mighty foes against the zerg on the ground, but I fear they will need protection against airborne threats such as mutalisks.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00040=Ah, this faithful Observer has kept watch since the evacuation. Its abilities will certainly prove useful now.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00041=This ancient beacon still thrums with power. I wonder...
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00042=Our base falls under a shadow -- the zerg will attack soon.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00043=I must find a way to establish a foothold and summon reinforcements to keep the zerg at bay!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00044=Some of these abandoned structures remain functional... we shall make use of them.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00045=We must be prepared to defend our base. The zerg are on the move.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00046=The first Overmind tendril!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00047=I sense... pain. Surprise. Death.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00048=The second Overmind tendril. I sense... death... and joy?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00049=The third Overmind tendril. I sense... satisfaction... in a plan set in motion long ago... and... fear of the future?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00050=The fourth Overmind tendril. I sense... an end. I must go to the Overmind Cortex to understand.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00051=The Overmind's cortex. If any trace impulse of the foul creature remains, it will be found here.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00052=Tassadar! But... you died... slaying this cursed Overmind!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00053=I have never tasted death, Zeratul -- nor shall I. But that is a tale for another time. I have come to tell you of this creature's... courage.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00054=Courage? It was an abomination!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00055=Not always. The zerg were... altered. A single over-riding purpose was forced upon them: the destruction of our people. (half of the sound in this line belongs on the next.)
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00056=Who did this? Why?
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00057=I know not. But the Overmind found a way to resist its all-consuming directive. It created a chance... a hope of salvation.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00058=Madness!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00059=Only she can free the zerg from slavery -- and in so doing, save all that is... from the flame.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00060=I do not understand, brother.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00061=Forget what you know, Zeratul. The Overmind saw a vision... the end of all things. (beat) And now you must see it too.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00062=No! This vision! I cannot bear it, stop!
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00073=Greetings, brother. I speak to you... from the Beyond.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00074=The Queen of Blades.
Conversation/TZeratul03/Line00075=The Overmind was formed with thought and reason... but not free will. It screamed and raged within the prison of its own mind.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00001=I remember the fall of Aiur. Don't much like the idea of havin' to see it all again. (beat) Guess there's nothin' for it.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00002=At the very apex of its victory against us, the zerg Overmind grew... overconfident.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00004=Now, all that was left of the mighty Overmind was a twisted, withered husk.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00006=Yet its countless minions, which seemed to be feeding from its dead husk, would prove somewhat... problematic. 
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00007=I needed to understand whatever memories lingered within the creature's rotting mass.
Conversation/TZeratul03Briefing/Line00008=Only by making contact with the gargantuan tendrils connected directly to its cortex could I learn its secrets.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00001=Protoss brethren, heed me! The last twilight has fallen. The galaxy burns around us! The terrans have been consumed. We are all that stands against the shadow.(beat) But if we are to meet our end this day, then we will do so AS ONE! En Taro Tassadar!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00002=I have rallied the last of our great fleet!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00003=Your timing is impeccable, Admiral Urun! When the enemy takes to the air, we will need your support.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00004=Our Void Rays are ready to do their part! Disengage prism inhibitors and concentrate all batteries on the hybrid! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00005=Well met, great Mohandar! For Aiur! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00006=This is the hour of truth, noble templar! Let the enemy know the wrath of Aiur's champions! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00007=Executor Selendis! Unleash the full power of your forces! There may be no tomorrow! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00008=En taro Tassadar, Zeratul! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00009= This is Hierarch Artanis commanding the Shield of Aiur! Our matrix-fields are within range! Engaging mass recall!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00010=The zerg are swarming at our flanks. We have to react quickly or our perimeter defenses will fall!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00011=I'm detecting a large amount of zerg activity in their hive-clusters! Prepare for an assault!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00012=Foolish, prideful children...There was one among you who could have jeopardized my great plan... but in your recklessness -- you mistook her for the true threat!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00013=The Queen of Blades... how could we have known?
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00014=The zerg performed their function as I planned...My Hybrid are proof of this. Now, the last of the protoss will fulfill their function...In death!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00015=Oblivion is all that awaits you.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00016=As I was your beginning - so shall I be... your end. 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00017=I will feast on your souls.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00018=Feel the cold embrace of death.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00019=There is no one left to save you. 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00020=All resistance will be eradicated.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00021=Your efforts are in vain.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00022=If only we had acted sooner...
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00023= There's just...too many of them...
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00024=I return...to the Void.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00025=Forgive me great Tassadar...I wasn't...strong enough.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00026=Kerrigan... how could we have known...
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00027=My brethren, hear me! For there is little time left. All that remains of our race, our civilization, are those that stand beside you now.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00028=Your light is expended. It is finished.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00029=All shall be remade in my name! Behold my greatest creation! 
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00030=Your efforts are futile. My harbingers will usher in a new age!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00031=Every hand is turned against you. Even the ground beneath your feet carries the seeds of your destruction!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00032=You have no place to hide and nowhere to run!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00033=These zerg! So different.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00034=Great one, the vault is prepared. Guard us while we preserve our knowledge for those that may follow. They must not make the mistakes we did.
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00035=Trust in each other. Strike as one will! Let our last stand burn a memory so bright, we will be remembered forever! En taro Tassadar!
Conversation/TZeratul04/Line00036=I love it when a plan comes together.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00001=I don't think I want to see any vision of the Overmind's... (sighs) But if Kerrigan's involved... I need to know.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00008=All will bow before the power... of the Fallen One.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00009=On a distant, shadowed world, the protoss will make their final stand. Their heroes will gather, their forces will be marshaled, and they will die bravely. But still, they will die.
Conversation/TZeratul04Briefing/Line00010=And my zerg... will be slaves... to the hybrid.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00001=Robbin' trains? We'll make a pirate out of you yet, Mister Raynor. (laughs)
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00002=Mercenaries are so untrustworthy. Not like rebels and pirates, right? (laughs)
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00003=UNN may never be on your side, but after today they smell blood on Mengsk. And that's good for all of us.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00004=Got yourself some colonists now, oh, and a pretty doctor. Best be careful with them.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00005=Stay away from the Voodoo.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00006=What'chu want?
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00007=Infestation be a terrible thing. But there are worse fates, believe me.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00008=We in it now, Brother.
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00009=I hear you've been makin' friends. That Valerian's tougher than he looks. He had to survive all alone while his daddy was off conquering the Sector. 
Conversation/ToshPissedLines/Line00010=You close to it now. Close to your prize.
Conversation/TychusPissedLines/Line00001=I don't even want to talk about what you found down there. Can't you see I'm drinkin'?
Conversation/TychusPissedLines/Line00002=Those colonists sure do have some zerg troubles.
Conversation/TychusPissedLines/Line00003=I don't think your buddy Horner likes me very much. I'll drink to that!
Conversation/TychusPissedLines/Line00004=When I get outta this suit, first thing I'm doin' is... well, I'd hate to offend your delicate sensibilities.
Conversation/TychusPissedLines/Line00005=You're lookin' a little pale there, Jimmy. What you need is another drink!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00001=Excelsior!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00002=Eureka!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00003=Fascinating!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00004=(humming)
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00005=Hmm, now where did I put my glasses?
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00006=Now if we just cross the diapoles thus, we'll see, oh yes...
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00007=The fellows will give me an award for this.
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00008=No, no, no. Transgenic not mutagenic!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00009=My word! A total inversion of Boyle's law!
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00010=We're not all mad you know.
Conversation/UnitVOScientist/Line00011=(insane giggling)
Conversation/Valerian/Line00001=Ah, Commander Raynor. I thought we might discuss the expedition to Char. Now --
Conversation/Valerian/Line00003=This is a dangerous game you're playing, kid. What's your stake in all this?
Conversation/Valerian/Line00005=Jim. I really think we should --
Conversation/Valerian/Line00006=I can see why my father wants to kill you.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00009=I asked you a question.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00010=Everyone wonders if I will be as good an emperor as my father. But I want something more. To prove that I will be a better emperor. And a better man.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00011=That shouldn't be hard.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00012=If I reform the worst mass murderer in history, make her human again... teamed with the famous outlaw Jim Raynor... it's all the proof I'll need.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00013=Somethin' on your mind, Valerian? 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00014=I just wanted to congratulate you, Commander. I doubt there's anyone alive that could have turned our calamitous invasion into a victory. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00015=We ain't achieved victory yet. And if I know Kerrigan, the worst is still to come.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00016=(haunted) I didn't anticipate her reacting so quickly. She seems to be a... fierce opponent. Perhaps we wouldn't have lost so many men if I'd--
Conversation/Valerian/Line00017=Now ain't the time for second guessing, junior. If we survive what's next, you'll have the whole rest of your life to wallow in guilt. For now, we buck up and get 'er done. 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00021=So I'm just a cog in your machine.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00022=If it gets you what you want, do you care?
Conversation/Valerian/Line00023=Guess I don't.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00028=Well, junior, we got our hands on the final artifact. You can take possession of the whole set at any time.  
Conversation/Valerian/Line00029=Thank you, Commander, and well done. You're every bit as resourceful as I've been led to believe. I think the odds are stacking in our favor.  
Conversation/Valerian/Line00030=You better hope so. Delivering this... artifact thing right to Kerrigan's doorstep - we're gonna need all the luck we can get.
Conversation/Valerian/Line00031=Rest easy. We'll have the might of the Dominion Fleet behind us! 
Conversation/Valerian/Line00032=(sarcastic) Right.
Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00001=Now I know old Arcturus thinks he's the center of the universe, but that's a bit much, don't ya think?  
Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00002=Actually, Commander, that painting depicts my grandfather, Angus Mengsk. It was a gift from his constituents on Korhal who honored his crusade against the vile Confederacy. 
Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00003=You've got some mighty big boots to fill, junior. In the end, the struggle for power killed your granddad and turned your daddy into a monster. You sure you know what you're getting into?
Conversation/Valerianfidgetspainting/Line00004=Don't worry about me, Commander. Though I honor my fathers, I follow in no man's footsteps. 
Conversation/WhenRoomsOpen/Line00001=Now that we've got some credits again, the boys have re-opened the cantina. First drink is on the house today.
Conversation/WhenRoomsOpen/Line00002=Stetmann says he's got the lab up and running. You should go down there and check it out.
Conversation/WhenRoomsOpen/Line00003=Sir, Stetmann says he's on the verge of a breakthrough in the lab. You should go talk to him.
